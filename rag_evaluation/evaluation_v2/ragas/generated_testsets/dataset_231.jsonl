{"user_input": "As a music historian specializing in the 1980s, can explain how Tumblr was related to the development of vaporwave, even if my grammar is not perfect and the question is a bit lengthy?", "reference_contexts": ["Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and a subgenre of hauntology, a visual art style, and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s,[30][31] and became well-known in 2015.[32] It is defined partly by its slowed-down, chopped and screwed samples of smooth jazz, 1970s elevator music,[32] R&B, and lounge music from the 1980s and 1990s, similar to synthwave. The surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism[33] and pop culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, stylized Ancient Greek or Roman sculptures, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos. Vaporwave originated as an ironic variant of chillwave, evolving from hypnagogic pop as well as similar retro-revivalist and post-Internet motifs that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the era, such as Tumblr's seapunk. The style was pioneered by producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin and Ramona Xavier, who each used various pseudonyms.[34] After Xavier's album Floral Shoppe (2011) established a blueprint for the genre, the movement built an audience on sites Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan while a flood of new acts, also operating under online pseudonyms, turned to Bandcamp for distribution. Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, mallsoft and hardvapour, although most have waned in popularity.[35] The genre also intersected with fashion trends such as streetwear and various political movements. Since the mid-2010s, vaporwave has been frequently described as a \"dead\" genre.[36] The general public came to view vaporwave as a facetious Internet meme, a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with vaporwave have since drifted into other musical styles.[35] Later in the 2010s, the genre spurred a revival of interest in Japanese ambient music and city pop.[37] Vaporwave is a hyper-specific subgenre, or \"microgenre\",[38] that is both a form of electronic music and an art style; however, it is sometimes suggested to be primarily a visual medium.[39] The genre is defined largely by its surrounding subculture,[40] with its music inextricable from its visual accoutrements.[39] Academic Laura Glitsos writes, \"In this way, vaporwave defies traditional music conventions that typically privilege the music over the visual form.\"[39] Musically, vaporwave reconfigures dance music from the 1980s and early 1990s[4] through the use of chopped and screwed techniques, repetition, and heavy reverb.[39] It is composed almost entirely from slowed-down samples[1] and its creation requires only the knowledge of rudimentary production techniques.[41] Although, some artists like Dan Mason create vaporwave music from scratch.[42] The name derives from \"vaporware\", a term for commercial software that is announced but never released.[40] It builds upon the satirical tendencies of chillwave and hypnagogic pop, while also being associated with an ambiguous or ironic take on consumer capitalism and technoculture.[1] Critic Adam Trainer writes of the style's predilection for \"music made less for enjoyment than for the regulation of mood\", such as corporate stock music for infomercials and product demonstrations.[43] Academic Adam Harper described the typical vaporwave track as \"a wholly synthesised or heavily processed chunk of corporate mood music, bright and earnest or slow and sultry, often beautiful, either looped out of sync and beyond the point of functionality.\"[1] Adding to its dual engagement with musical and visual art forms, vaporwave embraces the Internet as a cultural, social, and aesthetic medium.[40] The visual aesthetic (often stylized as \"ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ\", with fullwidth characters)[20] incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes,[12] as well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects.[44] VHS degradation is another common effect seen in vaporwave art. Generally, artists limit the chronology of their source material between Japan's economic flourishing in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com bubble burst of 2001 (some albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on their covers).[45][nb 1] Vaporwave originated on the Internet in the early 2010s as an ironic variant of chillwave[47] and as a derivation of the work of hypnagogic pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro, who were also characterized by the invocation of retro popular culture.[48] It was one of many Internet microgenres to emerge in this era, alongside witch house, seapunk, shitgaze, cloud rap, and others. Cloud rap artists like Bones and GothBoiClique especially drew heavily on vaporwave and witch house, with genre boundaries not becoming distinctly defined until later.[49][50] Vaporwave coincided with a broader trend involving young artists whose works drew from their childhoods in the 1980s.[51][nb 2] \"Chillwave\" and \"hypnagogic pop\" were coined at virtually the same time, in mid-2009, and were considered interchangeable terms. Like vaporwave, they engaged with notions of nostalgia and cultural memory.[52] Among the earliest hypnagogic acts to anticipate vaporwave was Matrix Metals and his album Flamingo Breeze (2009), which was built on synthesizer loops.[53] Around the same time, Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) uploaded a collection of plunderphonics loops to YouTube surreptitiously under the alias sunsetcorp.[35] These clips were taken from his audio-visual album Memory Vague (June 2009).[41][nb 3] Washed Out's \"Feel It All Around\" (June 2009), which slowed down the 1983 Italian dance song \"I Want You\" by Gary Low, exemplified the \"analog nostalgia\" of chillwave that vaporwave artists sought to reconfigure.[4] Vaporwave was subsumed under a larger \"Tumblr aesthetic\" that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the 2010s.[55] In 2010, Lopatin included several of the tracks from Memory Vague, as well as a few new ones, on his album Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1, released in August under the alias \"Chuck Person\".[56] With packaging that resembled the 1993 video game Ecco the Dolphin, the album inspired a host of suburban teens and young adults to formulate what would become vaporwave.[3] Seapunk followed in mid-2011 as"], "reference": "Vaporwave was subsumed under a larger \\\"Tumblr aesthetic\\\" that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the 2010s.

This circle included individuals known as Internet Club (Robin Burnett), Veracom, Luxury Elite, Infinity Frequencies, Transmuteo (Jonathan Dean), Coolmemoryz, and Prismcorp.[59] Numerous producers of this online milieu took inspiration from Ramona Xavier's New Dreams Ltd. (credited to \"Laserdisc Visions\", July 2011).[59] The first reported use of the term \"vaporwave\" was on an October 2011 blogpost by an anonymous user reviewing the album Surf's Pure Hearts by Girlhood;[40] however, Burnett has been credited with coining the term as a way to tie the circle together.[59] Xavier's Floral Shoppe (credited to \"Macintosh Plus\", December 2011) was the first album to be properly considered of the genre, containing all of the style's core elements.[24] Vaporwave found wider appeal over the middle of 2012, building an audience on sites like Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan.[59] On Tumblr, it became common for users to decorate their pages with vaporwave imagery.[55] In September, Blank Banshee released his debut album, Blank Banshee 0, which reflected a trend of vaporwave producers who were more influenced by trap music and less concerned with conveying political undertones.[24] Bandwagon called it a \"progressive record\" that, along with Floral Shoppe, \"signaled the end of the first wave of sample-heavy music, and ... reconfigured what it means to make vaporwave music.[3] After a flood of new vaporwave acts turned to Bandcamp for distribution, various online music publications such as Tiny Mix Tapes, Dummy Mag and Sputnikmusic began covering the movement.[16] However, writers, fans, and artists struggled to differentiate between vaporwave, chillwave, and hypnagogic pop,[60] while Ash Becks of The Essential noted that larger sites like Pitchfork and Drowned in Sound \"seemingly refused to touch vaporwave throughout the genre's two-year 'peak'.\"[16] Common criticisms were that the genre was either \"too dumb\" or \"too intellectual\".[61][nb 4] In November 2012, seapunk aesthetics were appropriated in music videos by the pop singers Rihanna and Azealia Banks. The exposure catapulted the subculture to the mainstream, and with it, vaporwave.[62] That same month, a video review of Floral Shoppe, published by the YouTuber Anthony Fantano, helped solidify the album as the representative work of vaporwave,[63] but was also credited as a pivotal moment in the decline of the genre.[64] Soon after vaporwave was spotlighted in the mainstream, it was frequently described as a \"dead\" genre.[36] Such pronouncements came from the fans themselves.[24] Following the initial wave, new terms were invented by users on 4chan and Reddit who sought to separate vaporwave into multiple subgenres.[35] Some were created in jest, such as \"vaportrap\", \"vapornoise\" and \"vaporgoth\".[22] Further subgenres included \"eccojams\", \"utopian virtual\", \"mallsoft\", \"future funk\", \"post-Internet\", \"late-nite lo-fi\", \"broken transmission\" (or \"signalwave\"), and \"hardvapour\".[65] Joe Price of Complex reported that \"most [of the subgenres] faded away, and many didn't make sense to begin with. ... The visual aspect formed faster than the sound, resulting in releases that look the same but fail to form a sonically cohesive whole.\"[35] In 2013, YouTube began allowing its users to host live streams, which resulted in a host of 24-hour \"radio stations\" dedicated to microgenres such as vaporwave and lo-fi hip hop.[68] The Swedish rapper Yung Lean and his Sad Boys collective inspired a wave of anonymous DJs to create vaporwave mixes, uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud, that appropriated the music and imagery of Nintendo 64 video games. Titles included \"Mariowave\", \"Nostalgia 64\", and \"ＺＥＬＤＡＷＡＶＥ\"[69] Dazed Digital's Evelyn Wang credited Lean with \"allowing vaporwave to leak IRL [and] encouraging its unholy coupling with streetwear\". She cited their associated fashion staples as \"frowny faces, Japanese and Arabic as accessories, sportswear brands, Arizona iced tea, and the uncanny ability to simultaneously communicate in and be a meme.\"[70][nb 5] At the end of 2013, Thump published an essay headlined \"Is Vaporwave the Next Seapunk?\".[35] Although the author prophesied that vaporwave would not end \"as a joke\" the way seapunk did, the genre came to be largely viewed as a facetious Internet meme based predominately on a retro visual style or \"vibe\", a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with the genre later drifted into other musical styles.[35] In 2015, Rolling Stone published a list that included vaporwave act 2814 as one of \"10 artists you need to know\", citing their album Birth of a New Day (新しい日の誕生) as \"an unparalleled success within a small, passionate pocket of the internet.\"[72] The album I'll Try Living Like This by Death's Dynamic Shroud.wmv was featured at number fifteen on the Fact list \"The 50 Best Albums of 2015\",[73] and on the same day MTV International introduced a rebrand heavily inspired by vaporwave and seapunk,[74] Tumblr launched a GIF viewer named Tumblr TV, with an explicitly MTV-styled visual spin.[75] Hip-hop artist Drake's single \"Hotline Bling\", released on July 31, also became popular with vaporwave producers, inspiring both humorous and serious remixes of the tune.[3] As"], "reference": "The musical template for vaporwave came from Eccojams and Ferraro's Far Side Virtual (October 2011).

{"user_input": "Considering vaporwave's origins as a microgenre of electronic music that incorporates early Internet imagery and late 1990s web design, how did it relate to other Internet subcultures like seapunk, particularly in their shared use of Geocities web graphics, and how did this aesthetic influence its reception and evolution?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nVaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and a subgenre of hauntology, a visual art style, and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s,[30][31] and became well-known in 2015.[32] It is defined partly by its slowed-down, chopped and screwed samples of smooth jazz, 1970s elevator music,[32] R&B, and lounge music from the 1980s and 1990s, similar to synthwave. The surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism[33] and pop culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, stylized Ancient Greek or Roman sculptures, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos. Vaporwave originated as an ironic variant of chillwave, evolving from hypnagogic pop as well as similar retro-revivalist and post-Internet motifs that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the era, such as Tumblr's seapunk. The style was pioneered by producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin and Ramona Xavier, who each used various pseudonyms.[34] After Xavier's album Floral Shoppe (2011) established a blueprint for the genre, the movement built an audience on sites Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan while a flood of new acts, also operating under online pseudonyms, turned to Bandcamp for distribution. Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, mallsoft and hardvapour, although most have waned in popularity.[35] The genre also intersected with fashion trends such as streetwear and various political movements. Since the mid-2010s, vaporwave has been frequently described as a \"dead\" genre.[36] The general public came to view vaporwave as a facetious Internet meme, a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with vaporwave have since drifted into other musical styles.[35] Later in the 2010s, the genre spurred a revival of interest in Japanese ambient music and city pop.[37] Vaporwave is a hyper-specific subgenre, or \"microgenre\",[38] that is both a form of electronic music and an art style; however, it is sometimes suggested to be primarily a visual medium.[39] The genre is defined largely by its surrounding subculture,[40] with its music inextricable from its visual accoutrements.[39] Academic Laura Glitsos writes, \"In this way, vaporwave defies traditional music conventions that typically privilege the music over the visual form.\"[39] Musically, vaporwave reconfigures dance music from the 1980s and early 1990s[4] through the use of chopped and screwed techniques, repetition, and heavy reverb.[39] It is composed almost entirely from slowed-down samples[1] and its creation requires only the knowledge of rudimentary production techniques.[41] Although, some artists like Dan Mason create vaporwave music from scratch.[42] The name derives from \"vaporware\", a term for commercial software that is announced but never released.[40] It builds upon the satirical tendencies of chillwave and hypnagogic pop, while also being associated with an ambiguous or ironic take on consumer capitalism and technoculture.[1] Critic Adam Trainer writes of the style's predilection for \"music made less for enjoyment than for the regulation of mood\", such as corporate stock music for infomercials and product demonstrations.[43] Academic Adam Harper described the typical vaporwave track as \"a wholly synthesised or heavily processed chunk of corporate mood music, bright and earnest or slow and sultry, often beautiful, either looped out of sync and beyond the point of functionality.\"[1] Adding to its dual engagement with musical and visual art forms, vaporwave embraces the Internet as a cultural, social, and aesthetic medium.[40] The visual aesthetic (often stylized as \"ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ\", with fullwidth characters)[20] incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes,[12] as well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects.[44] VHS degradation is another common effect seen in vaporwave art. Generally, artists limit the chronology of their source material between Japan's economic flourishing in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com bubble burst of 2001 (some albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on their covers).[45][nb 1] Vaporwave originated on the Internet in the early 2010s as an ironic variant of chillwave[47] and as a derivation of the work of hypnagogic pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro, who were also characterized by the invocation of retro popular culture.[48] It was one of many Internet microgenres to emerge in this era, alongside witch house, seapunk, shitgaze, cloud rap, and others. Cloud rap artists like Bones and GothBoiClique especially drew heavily on vaporwave and witch house, with genre boundaries not becoming distinctly defined until later.[49][50] Vaporwave coincided with a broader trend involving young artists whose works drew from their childhoods in the 1980s.[51][nb 2] \"Chillwave\" and \"hypnagogic pop\" were coined at virtually the same time, in mid-2009, and were considered interchangeable terms. Like vaporwave, they engaged with notions of nostalgia and cultural memory.[52] Among the earliest hypnagogic acts to anticipate vaporwave was Matrix Metals and his album Flamingo Breeze (2009), which was built on synthesizer loops.[53] Around the same time, Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) uploaded a collection of plunderphonics loops to YouTube surreptitiously under the alias sunsetcorp.[35] These clips were taken from his audio-visual album Memory Vague (June 2009).[41][nb 3] Washed Out's \"Feel It All Around\" (June 2009), which slowed down the 1983 Italian dance song \"I Want You\" by Gary Low, exemplified the \"analog nostalgia\" of chillwave that vaporwave artists sought to reconfigure.[4] Vaporwave was subsumed under a larger \"Tumblr aesthetic\" that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the 2010s.[55] In 2010, Lopatin included several of the tracks from Memory Vague, as well as a few new ones, on his album Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1, released in August under the alias \"Chuck Person\".[56] With packaging that resembled the 1993 video game Ecco the Dolphin, the album inspired a host of suburban teens and young adults to formulate what would become vaporwave.[3] Seapunk followed in mid-2011 as", "<2-hop>\n\nan aquatic-themed Tumblr subculture and Internet meme[57] that presaged vaporwave in its concern for \"spacey\" electronic music and Geocities web graphics.[12] Like vaporwave, it was defined by its engagement with the Internet, an approach that is sometimes described as post-Internet.[17] The musical template for vaporwave came from Eccojams and Ferraro's Far Side Virtual (October 2011).[45][16][58] Eccojams featured chopped and screwed variations on popular 1980s pop songs,[3] while Far Side Virtual drew primarily on \"the grainy and bombastic beeps\" of past media such as Skype and the Nintendo Wii.[45] According to Stereogum's Miles Bowe, vaporwave was a fusion between Lopatin's \"chopped and screwed plunderphonics\" and the \"nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraro's Muzak-hellscapes\".[10] A 2013 post on a music blog presented those albums, along with Skeleton's Holograms (November 2010), as \"proto vaporwave\".[56] Vaporwave artists were originally \"mysterious and often nameless entities that lurk the internet,\" Adam Harper noted, \"often behind a pseudo-corporate name or web façade, and whose music is typically free to download through MediaFire, Last FM, Soundcloud or Bandcamp.\"[1] According to Metallic Ghosts (Chaz Allen), the original vaporwave scene came out of an online circle formulated on the site Turntable.fm. This circle included individuals known as Internet Club (Robin Burnett), Veracom, Luxury Elite, Infinity Frequencies, Transmuteo (Jonathan Dean), Coolmemoryz, and Prismcorp.[59] Numerous producers of this online milieu took inspiration from Ramona Xavier's New Dreams Ltd. (credited to \"Laserdisc Visions\", July 2011).[59] The first reported use of the term \"vaporwave\" was on an October 2011 blogpost by an anonymous user reviewing the album Surf's Pure Hearts by Girlhood;[40] however, Burnett has been credited with coining the term as a way to tie the circle together.[59] Xavier's Floral Shoppe (credited to \"Macintosh Plus\", December 2011) was the first album to be properly considered of the genre, containing all of the style's core elements.[24] Vaporwave found wider appeal over the middle of 2012, building an audience on sites like Last.fm, Reddit and 4chan.[59] On Tumblr, it became common for users to decorate their pages with vaporwave imagery.[55] In September, Blank Banshee released his debut album, Blank Banshee 0, which reflected a trend of vaporwave producers who were more influenced by trap music and less concerned with conveying political undertones.[24] Bandwagon called it a \"progressive record\" that, along with Floral Shoppe, \"signaled the end of the first wave of sample-heavy music, and ... reconfigured what it means to make vaporwave music.[3] After a flood of new vaporwave acts turned to Bandcamp for distribution, various online music publications such as Tiny Mix Tapes, Dummy Mag and Sputnikmusic began covering the movement.[16] However, writers, fans, and artists struggled to differentiate between vaporwave, chillwave, and hypnagogic pop,[60] while Ash Becks of The Essential noted that larger sites like Pitchfork and Drowned in Sound \"seemingly refused to touch vaporwave throughout the genre's two-year 'peak'.\"[16] Common criticisms were that the genre was either \"too dumb\" or \"too intellectual\".[61][nb 4] In November 2012, seapunk aesthetics were appropriated in music videos by the pop singers Rihanna and Azealia Banks. The exposure catapulted the subculture to the mainstream, and with it, vaporwave.[62] That same month, a video review of Floral Shoppe, published by the YouTuber Anthony Fantano, helped solidify the album as the representative work of vaporwave,[63] but was also credited as a pivotal moment in the decline of the genre.[64] Soon after vaporwave was spotlighted in the mainstream, it was frequently described as a \"dead\" genre.[36] Such pronouncements came from the fans themselves.[24] Following the initial wave, new terms were invented by users on 4chan and Reddit who sought to separate vaporwave into multiple subgenres.[35] Some were created in jest, such as \"vaportrap\", \"vapornoise\" and \"vaporgoth\".[22] Further subgenres included \"eccojams\", \"utopian virtual\", \"mallsoft\", \"future funk\", \"post-Internet\", \"late-nite lo-fi\", \"broken transmission\" (or \"signalwave\"), and \"hardvapour\".[65] Joe Price of Complex reported that \"most [of the subgenres] faded away, and many didn't make sense to begin with. ... The visual aspect formed faster than the sound, resulting in releases that look the same but fail to form a sonically cohesive whole.\"[35] In 2013, YouTube began allowing its users to host live streams, which resulted in a host of 24-hour \"radio stations\" dedicated to microgenres such as vaporwave and lo-fi hip hop.[68] The Swedish rapper Yung Lean and his Sad Boys collective inspired a wave of anonymous DJs to create vaporwave mixes, uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud, that appropriated the music and imagery of Nintendo 64 video games. Titles included \"Mariowave\", \"Nostalgia 64\", and \"ＺＥＬＤＡＷＡＶＥ\"[69] Dazed Digital's Evelyn Wang credited Lean with \"allowing vaporwave to leak IRL [and] encouraging its unholy coupling with streetwear\". She cited their associated fashion staples as \"frowny faces, Japanese and Arabic as accessories, sportswear brands, Arizona iced tea, and the uncanny ability to simultaneously communicate in and be a meme.\"[70][nb 5] At the end of 2013, Thump published an essay headlined \"Is Vaporwave the Next Seapunk?\".[35] Although the author prophesied that vaporwave would not end \"as a joke\" the way seapunk did, the genre came to be largely viewed as a facetious Internet meme based predominately on a retro visual style or \"vibe\", a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with the genre later drifted into other musical styles.[35] In 2015, Rolling Stone published a list that included vaporwave act 2814 as one of \"10 artists you need to know\", citing their album Birth of a New Day (新しい日の誕生) as \"an unparalleled success within a small, passionate pocket of the internet.\"[72] The album I'll Try Living Like This by Death's Dynamic Shroud.wmv was featured at number fifteen on the Fact list \"The 50 Best Albums of 2015\",[73] and on the same day MTV International introduced a rebrand heavily inspired by vaporwave and seapunk,[74] Tumblr launched a GIF viewer named Tumblr TV, with an explicitly MTV-styled visual spin.[75] Hip-hop artist Drake's single \"Hotline Bling\", released on July 31, also became popular with vaporwave producers, inspiring both humorous and serious remixes of the tune.[3] As"], "reference": "Vaporwave emerged as a microgenre of electronic music in the early 2010s, incorporating elements like slowed-down samples and early Internet imagery.

He added that \"Users of the various vaporwave sub-Reddits will always take it very seriously for the most part, but even there people are discussing whether or not vaporwave is still going strong.\"[35][nb 6] Despite their objections to the label, serious artists of the movement continued to be tagged as vaporwave.[76] In 2019, user comments that state \"ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ\" remained ubiquitous on YouTube videos concerning the Internet.[77] George Clanton, a prominent figure in the genre, commented that the \"vaporwave\" banner still functioned well as a marketing tag for music that is not necessarily considered of the genre.[76][78] In September, he organized the first-ever vaporwave festival, 100% ElectroniCON, in New York City, where various artists associated with the genre such as Saint Pepsi, Vaperror, Nmesh, 18 Carat Affair, and Clanton himself performed live, most of them for the first time in their careers.[61][78] In December 2012, Dummy published what was considered the \"definitive\" article on vaporwave, authored by Adam Harper, in which he equated the genre to accelerationist political theory. The article had the effect of inspiring \"a wave of content ambiguously celebrating a dystopian capitalism\".[79] In early 2016, the satirical publication Rave News reported that prominent vaporwave producers had scheduled an emergency summit in Montreal to discuss \"creeping fascism\" in the scene. Although the article was facetious, its comment section attracted many vaporwave fans who defended such political beliefs.[29] In August, Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin recommended that alt-right members embrace synthwave instead of the rock genres traditionally associated with far-right movements, as he felt that synthwave represented the \"Whitest music ever\". His remarks popularized the musical and visual aesthetic dubbed \"fashwave\", an updating of fascist tropes inspired by vaporwave that was celebrated by many members of the alt-right.[80] (see also Vaporwave § Fashwave) In 2017, Vice's Penn Bullock and Eli Penn reported on the phenomenon of self-identified fascists and alt-right members appropriating vaporwave music and aesthetics, describing the fashwave movement as \"the first fascist music that is easy enough on the ears to have mainstream appeal\" and reflective of \"a global cybernetic subculture geared towards millennials, propagated by memes like Pepe the Frog, and centered on sites like 4chan\".[29][nb 7] The Guardian's Michael Hann noted that the movement is not unprecedented; similar offshoots occurred in punk rock in the 1980s and black metal in the 1990s. Hann believed that, like those genres, there was little chance fashwave would ever \"impinge on the mainstream\".[81] By 2019, pink vaporwave-inspired hats that promoted 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang became popular among his supporters. National Review commentator Theodore Kopfre reported that it was part of a trend indicating that Yang had \"replaced Donald Trump as the meme candidate.\"[82] Vaporwave was one of several microgenres spawned in the early 2010s that were the brief focus of media attention.[50] Users on various music forums, as quoted by Vice, variously characterized the genre as \"chillwave for Marxists\", \"post-elevator music\", and \"corporate smooth jazz Windows 95 pop\".[12] Its circulation was more akin to an Internet meme than typical music genres of the past, as authors Georgina Born and Christopher Haworth wrote in 2017, Vaporwave's cultural practices knowingly replicate and parody the addictive, almost compulsory participation that feeds social networks, where the voluntary labor of the user community drives the system and generates value. Anyone with an Internet connection can produce vaporwave ... The uniformity of these memes is encouraged by their rapid imitation among the genre's hyperactive online subculture, fueled by affective contagion.[83] Pitchfork contributor Jonny Coleman defined vaporwave as residing in \"the uncanny genre valley\" that lies \"between a real genre that sounds fake and a fake genre that could be real.\"[47] Also from Pitchfork, Patrick St. Michel calls vaporwave a \"niche corner of Internet music populated by Westerners goofing around with Japanese music, samples, and language\".[84] Vice writer Rob Arcand commented that the \"rapid proliferation of subgenres has itself become part of the \"vaporwave\" punchline, gesturing at the absurdity of the genre itself even as it sees artists using it as a springboard for innovation.\"[22] Speaking about the \"supposedly subversive or parodic elements\" of vaporwave in 2018, cultural critic Simon Reynolds said that the genre had been made redundant, in some respects, by modern trap music and mainstream hip hop.

It is a hybrid of deep house, gqom, jazz, soul and lounge music characterized by synths and wide, percussive basslines. The word \"amapiano\" derives from the IsiZulu word for \"pianos\". There is ambiguity and debate concerning its origin, with various accounts of the musical styles in the Johannesburg townships.[1][2][3][4] Because it has some similarities with bacardi house,[5][6] some people assert the genre began in Pretoria but it remains uncertain.[7][8][9] Various accounts of who formed the popular genre make it impossible to accurately pinpoint its origin.[4][10] The word amapiano is a Zulu word that can be loosely translated to \"the pianos\".[11][12][13] The genre is mostly sung in one of South Africa's indigenous languages such as Zulu, Xhosa, and Southern Sotho, Northern Sotho, Setswana, English, Xitsonga, Tshivenda. Amapiano is distinguished by piano melodies, deep house, soul, kwaito and log drum basslines. The genre's sample packs often incorporate sounds sourced from gqom music. Bacardi, is often misperceived either as a subgenre of amapiano or having emerged in the 2020s.[14][3][15][16][17][5] A popular element of the genre is the use of the log drum (an electronic version of the West African originating log drum),[18][19] a wide percussive bassline, which was popularized in amapiano music by several producers such as MDU aka TRP. According to one of the amapiano pioneers, Kabza De Small, he asserts that: \"I don't know what happened. I don't know how he figured out the log drum. Amapiano music has always been there, but he's the one who came up with the log drum sound. These boys like experimenting. They always check out new plug-ins. So when MDU figured it out, he ran with it.\"[20] The use of an electronic or the log drum sound in African music predates amapiano although the contrary is often misperceived, and was possibly developed from the traditional or acoustic West African log drum by kwaito pioneer M'du (also known as Mdu Masilela).[19][21][18] Afropiano also referred to as Nigerian amapiano, a blend of afrobeats and amapiano, gained prominence in the early 2020s as a popular variant of afrobeats. Pioneers of the genre include Clemzy and L.A.X.[22][23] Bique employs a prominently undulated log drum sound and derives its name from the Southeastern African country, Mozambique. Notable illustrations of bique are \"Ize (Bique Mix)\" by ZanTen and DJ SOL K, FOI and Jay Music's \"Bique (Deep Groove)\", songs.[17] Bongopiano is a fusion genre that blends bongo flava music and amapiano, emerging in Tanzania during the 2020s. In the 2020s, numerous prominent Tanzanian musical artists including Diamond Platnumz, Marioo, Harmonize, Nandy, Jux, Mbosso and Zuchu released notable bongopiano songs.[24] In the mid-2010s circa early 2020s, Gqom 2.0 emerged as a subgenre of gqom,[25][26] alongside other gqom variants for instance 3-Step and sgubhu.[27][28][29] Gqom 2.0 is distinguished by a slowed-down tempo fused with elements of amapiano, afrohouse and afrotech.[26] New Age Bacardi denotes the fusion of bacardi with amapiano that emerged circa mid-2021 illustrated by the Mellow & Sleazy track \"Trust Fund\" which featured Kabza De Small, Mpura, Focalistic and DJ Maphorisa. DJ Maphorisa highlighted that Pretoria-based record producers played a key role in merging the musical styles and that the pace of new age bacardi had been slowed-down from the original fast-paced bacardi tempos.[6]", "<8-hop>\n\nOjapiano is a fusion of the traditional Igbo instrument Ọjà and subgenre of amapiano which emerged in Nigeria in the early 2020s.

There have been several pioneers of the genre since its emergence including Kcee, Snazzy the Optimist, Oxlade and renowned American pop rock band OneRepublic.[30][31][32][33] Popiano blends pop with amapiano.[34] A notable illustration is the 2021 single \"Overdue\" by record producers Kooldrink, DJ Lag and singer, Tyla which showcased a fusion of popiano and gqom.[35] Since popiano's inception Tyla has been deemed \"The Queen of Popiano\".[34] Private school piano also known as soulful amapiano is distinguished by its use of shakers, mellow log drum sounds and progressive chord sequences. Private school piano is primarily credited to Kelvin Momo. The genre frequently incorporates live instrumentation, including the guitar, saxophone, violin and trumpet.[36] Quantum sound is a genre characterized by re-edits, fundamentally rooted in and influenced by gqom, particularly the taxi kick style. The genre is attributed to several record producers including RealShaunMusiq, Sizwe Nineteen and Nandipha808.[37] In 2019, the genre experienced increased popularity across the African continent, with noted increases in digital streams and chart successes in countries far from its South African origin.[38][39] In 2021, an awards ceremony was created that was dedicated to the genre, the South Africa Amapiano Music Awards.[40] In 2022, the American online music store Beatport added the genre to its platform with its own dedicated charts and playlists.[41] The genre was popular amongst young people on social media platforms, where videos using amapiano music were uploaded, which fueled the dancing scene in South Africa.[42] Amapiano music has always been dominated mainly by men. Social media users in South Africa are constantly fighting to change the narratives about how they helped the country advance.[how?][43] In October 2023, the afrobeats and amapiano fusion song \"Water\" by Tyla gained international prominence following a viral bacardi house dance challenge on social media.[44] It became the first song by a South African soloist to enter the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 55 years,[45] and was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand, where it reached number one.

{"user_input": "Considering the origins of pop music and its evolution, how did house-pop emerge as a crossover genre, and what are its defining characteristics that differentiate it from other subgenres of pop music, especially in terms of making house music more radio friendly?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nPop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom.[1] The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse-chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country. Below is a list of styles of pop music. Traditional pop (also known as classic pop and pre-rock and roll pop) is Western popular music that generally pre-dates the advent of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. The most popular and enduring songs from this era of music are known as pop standards or American standards. The works of these songwriters and composers are usually considered part of the canon known as the \"Great American Songbook\". More generally, the term \"standard\" can be applied to any popular song that has become very widely known within mainstream culture. AllMusic defines traditional pop as \"post-big band and pre-rock & roll pop music\".[2] Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock 'n roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s.[3] It originated from black American music such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues,[4] as well as country music.[5] While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s[6] and in country records of the 1930s,[5] the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.[7] Early pop music drew on the sentimental ballad for its form, gained its use of vocal harmonies from gospel and soul music, instrumentation from jazz and rock music, orchestration from classical music, tempo from dance music, backing from electronic music, rhythmic elements from hip-hop music, and spoken passages from rap.[1][verification needed] Below are genres that exclusively considered as subgenres of pop. Note that music styles like dance, electronic, opera, and orchestra are not considered as standalone genres. Dark pop (often typeset with a hyphen) is a subgenre of pop music that combines elements of alternative and indie with pop music. It is characterized by its deep melancholic sound and minimalistic electronic production. Often dark pop features heavy synths, distorted guitars, and electronic drums.[8] The trend began in the 1980's with grunge, a genre that also dealt with depressing topics about heartbreak, loss and loneliness, similar to topics expressed in dark pop. By the 1990s, dark pop drew from trip-hop, gothic rock, and avant-garde traditions, evolving and disengaging into a distinct style that emphasized atmospheric texture and introspective storytelling. However dark pop isn't avant-garde, often having a more mainstream sound. Many artists also started to incorporate dark pop with punk, rap and electronic sounds. During the 2010's, these innfusions became prominent as it gained mainstream traction by well known artists such as Rina Sawayama who infused it with electronic club music. A notable dark pop song, that also incorporated electronic sounds is singer and social media personality Bella Poarch's debut single \"Build a Bitch\".[9][10][11][12] Below are styles of pop music that mixed with other standalone genres. [citation needed] Rolling Stone and The New York Times have used the term disco-pop as early as 1976 and 1978 respectively. The publications referring to songs such as \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" by Elton John and Kiki Dee and \"Heart of Gold\" by Boney M. while stating the music of the Salsoul Orchestra was \"material and arrangements are unalloyed disco pop.\"[13][14] Retrospectively, albums such as Michael Jackson's Off the Wall have been referred to as the genre.[15] With the release of Saturday Night Fever's film and album leading disco music to explode in popularity in 1978. This led to thousands of discotheque moguls and their patrons to mimic what hcontorted versions of dance culture. Tim Lawrence wrote on this phenomnen as interesting, but that \"while the initial experience was thrilling, the effect soon began to fade or, worse still, jar. By 1979 the combination of the shrill white disco pop that had come to dominate the charts\".[16] Around the 2000s, some new songs were described as disco-pop, including \"Sing It Back\" by Moloko, \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor.[17][18][19] Allure stated in 2020 that there was a disco-pop revival in music, such as Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia and Lady Gaga's Chromatica.[20] Other artists who contributed to the revival included Doja Cat, Victoria Monet, and Jessie Ware.[21]", "<2-hop>\n\nHouse-pop (sometimes also called \"pop-house\")[22] is a crossover of house and dance-pop music that emerged in early '90s.[23] The genre was created to make house music more radio friendly.[24] The characteristic of house-pop is similar to diva house music, like over-the-top vocal acrobatics, bubbly synth riffs, and four-on-the-floor rhythm. House-pop also has hip-hop influence.[23] Pop soul / Motown is a genre of soul music that has upbeat tempo and given a commercially viable, crossover production.[26] The vocals are still raw, but the material and the sound of the record could easily fit onto pop radio stations' playlists. Motown was the pioneering label of pop soul, and through much of the 1960s, it was one of the most popular pop music genres. In the 1970s, pop soul became slicker, and it eventually metamorphosed into disco.[27] Luther Vandross is an example of pop soul musician.[28] Street pop, or street hop, is an experimental, hybrid rap genre that blends Nigerian street music, Nigerian hip hop, Afrobeats and pop with African and Western electronic dance music elements like gqom. It features uptempo beats, including slower-paced beats and variation styles. The genre combines Western and Nigerian pop influences to create a distinctive, evolving sound. Key musical artists like Olamide, Asake, Zinoleesky, Naira Marley and Seyi Vibez, highlight its fusion of traditional and modern elements.[29][30][31] Below are pop music that related to avant-garde culture.

Private school piano is primarily credited to Kelvin Momo. The genre frequently incorporates live instrumentation, including the guitar, saxophone, violin and trumpet.[36] Quantum sound is a genre characterized by re-edits, fundamentally rooted in and influenced by gqom, particularly the taxi kick style. The genre is attributed to several record producers including RealShaunMusiq, Sizwe Nineteen and Nandipha808.[37] In 2019, the genre experienced increased popularity across the African continent, with noted increases in digital streams and chart successes in countries far from its South African origin.[38][39] In 2021, an awards ceremony was created that was dedicated to the genre, the South Africa Amapiano Music Awards.[40] In 2022, the American online music store Beatport added the genre to its platform with its own dedicated charts and playlists.[41] The genre was popular amongst young people on social media platforms, where videos using amapiano music were uploaded, which fueled the dancing scene in South Africa.[42] Amapiano music has always been dominated mainly by men. Social media users in South Africa are constantly fighting to change the narratives about how they helped the country advance.[how?][43] In October 2023, the afrobeats and amapiano fusion song \"Water\" by Tyla gained international prominence following a viral bacardi house dance challenge on social media.[44] It became the first song by a South African soloist to enter the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 55 years,[45] and was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand, where it reached number one. South Korean girl group Le Sserafim took inspiration from amapiano for their track \"Smart\" off of their third EP, Easy.[46] Chinese rapper Vinida Weng blended amapiano with Fujianese rap for her track \"Waiya!\".[47]", "<2-hop>\n\nHouse-pop (sometimes also called \"pop-house\")[22] is a crossover of house and dance-pop music that emerged in early '90s.[23] The genre was created to make house music more radio friendly.[24] The characteristic of house-pop is similar to diva house music, like over-the-top vocal acrobatics, bubbly synth riffs, and four-on-the-floor rhythm. House-pop also has hip-hop influence.[23] Pop soul / Motown is a genre of soul music that has upbeat tempo and given a commercially viable, crossover production.[26] The vocals are still raw, but the material and the sound of the record could easily fit onto pop radio stations' playlists. Motown was the pioneering label of pop soul, and through much of the 1960s, it was one of the most popular pop music genres. In the 1970s, pop soul became slicker, and it eventually metamorphosed into disco.[27] Luther Vandross is an example of pop soul musician.[28] Street pop, or street hop, is an experimental, hybrid rap genre that blends Nigerian street music, Nigerian hip hop, Afrobeats and pop with African and Western electronic dance music elements like gqom.

The article had the effect of inspiring \"a wave of content ambiguously celebrating a dystopian capitalism\".[79] In early 2016, the satirical publication Rave News reported that prominent vaporwave producers had scheduled an emergency summit in Montreal to discuss \"creeping fascism\" in the scene. Although the article was facetious, its comment section attracted many vaporwave fans who defended such political beliefs.[29] In August, Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin recommended that alt-right members embrace synthwave instead of the rock genres traditionally associated with far-right movements, as he felt that synthwave represented the \"Whitest music ever\". His remarks popularized the musical and visual aesthetic dubbed \"fashwave\", an updating of fascist tropes inspired by vaporwave that was celebrated by many members of the alt-right.[80] (see also Vaporwave § Fashwave) In 2017, Vice's Penn Bullock and Eli Penn reported on the phenomenon of self-identified fascists and alt-right members appropriating vaporwave music and aesthetics, describing the fashwave movement as \"the first fascist music that is easy enough on the ears to have mainstream appeal\" and reflective of \"a global cybernetic subculture geared towards millennials, propagated by memes like Pepe the Frog, and centered on sites like 4chan\".[29][nb 7] The Guardian's Michael Hann noted that the movement is not unprecedented; similar offshoots occurred in punk rock in the 1980s and black metal in the 1990s. Hann believed that, like those genres, there was little chance fashwave would ever \"impinge on the mainstream\".[81] By 2019, pink vaporwave-inspired hats that promoted 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang became popular among his supporters. National Review commentator Theodore Kopfre reported that it was part of a trend indicating that Yang had \"replaced Donald Trump as the meme candidate.\"[82] Vaporwave was one of several microgenres spawned in the early 2010s that were the brief focus of media attention.[50] Users on various music forums, as quoted by Vice, variously characterized the genre as \"chillwave for Marxists\", \"post-elevator music\", and \"corporate smooth jazz Windows 95 pop\".[12] Its circulation was more akin to an Internet meme than typical music genres of the past, as authors Georgina Born and Christopher Haworth wrote in 2017, Vaporwave's cultural practices knowingly replicate and parody the addictive, almost compulsory participation that feeds social networks, where the voluntary labor of the user community drives the system and generates value. Anyone with an Internet connection can produce vaporwave ... The uniformity of these memes is encouraged by their rapid imitation among the genre's hyperactive online subculture, fueled by affective contagion.[83] Pitchfork contributor Jonny Coleman defined vaporwave as residing in \"the uncanny genre valley\" that lies \"between a real genre that sounds fake and a fake genre that could be real.\"[47] Also from Pitchfork, Patrick St. Michel calls vaporwave a \"niche corner of Internet music populated by Westerners goofing around with Japanese music, samples, and language\".[84] Vice writer Rob Arcand commented that the \"rapid proliferation of subgenres has itself become part of the \"vaporwave\" punchline, gesturing at the absurdity of the genre itself even as it sees artists using it as a springboard for innovation.\"[22] Speaking about the \"supposedly subversive or parodic elements\" of vaporwave in 2018, cultural critic Simon Reynolds said that the genre had been made redundant, in some respects, by modern trap music and mainstream hip hop. He opined: \"What could be more insane or morbid than the subjectivity in a Drake record or a Kanye song?

It is a hybrid of deep house, gqom, jazz, soul and lounge music characterized by synths and wide, percussive basslines. The word \"amapiano\" derives from the IsiZulu word for \"pianos\". There is ambiguity and debate concerning its origin, with various accounts of the musical styles in the Johannesburg townships.[1][2][3][4] Because it has some similarities with bacardi house,[5][6] some people assert the genre began in Pretoria but it remains uncertain.[7][8][9] Various accounts of who formed the popular genre make it impossible to accurately pinpoint its origin.[4][10] The word amapiano is a Zulu word that can be loosely translated to \"the pianos\".[11][12][13] The genre is mostly sung in one of South Africa's indigenous languages such as Zulu, Xhosa, and Southern Sotho, Northern Sotho, Setswana, English, Xitsonga, Tshivenda. Amapiano is distinguished by piano melodies, deep house, soul, kwaito and log drum basslines. The genre's sample packs often incorporate sounds sourced from gqom music. Bacardi, is often misperceived either as a subgenre of amapiano or having emerged in the 2020s.[14][3][15][16][17][5] A popular element of the genre is the use of the log drum (an electronic version of the West African originating log drum),[18][19] a wide percussive bassline, which was popularized in amapiano music by several producers such as MDU aka TRP. According to one of the amapiano pioneers, Kabza De Small, he asserts that: \"I don't know what happened. I don't know how he figured out the log drum. Amapiano music has always been there, but he's the one who came up with the log drum sound. These boys like experimenting. They always check out new plug-ins. So when MDU figured it out, he ran with it.\"[20] The use of an electronic or the log drum sound in African music predates amapiano although the contrary is often misperceived, and was possibly developed from the traditional or acoustic West African log drum by kwaito pioneer M'du (also known as Mdu Masilela).[19][21][18] Afropiano also referred to as Nigerian amapiano, a blend of afrobeats and amapiano, gained prominence in the early 2020s as a popular variant of afrobeats. Pioneers of the genre include Clemzy and L.A.X.[22][23] Bique employs a prominently undulated log drum sound and derives its name from the Southeastern African country, Mozambique. Notable illustrations of bique are \"Ize (Bique Mix)\" by ZanTen and DJ SOL K, FOI and Jay Music's \"Bique (Deep Groove)\", songs.[17] Bongopiano is a fusion genre that blends bongo flava music and amapiano, emerging in Tanzania during the 2020s. In the 2020s, numerous prominent Tanzanian musical artists including Diamond Platnumz, Marioo, Harmonize, Nandy, Jux, Mbosso and Zuchu released notable bongopiano songs.[24] In the mid-2010s circa early 2020s, Gqom 2.0 emerged as a subgenre of gqom,[25][26] alongside other gqom variants for instance 3-Step and sgubhu.[27][28][29] Gqom 2.0 is distinguished by a slowed-down tempo fused with elements of amapiano, afrohouse and afrotech.[26] New Age Bacardi denotes the fusion of bacardi with amapiano that emerged circa mid-2021 illustrated by the Mellow & Sleazy track \"Trust Fund\" which featured Kabza De Small, Mpura, Focalistic and DJ Maphorisa.
