{"user_input": "What is handbag house?", "reference_contexts": ["Diva house or handbag house is an anthemic subgenre of house music that became most popular in gay clubs during the second half of the 1990s. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture defines handbag house as having \"prominent female vocals, breakdowns, and a proliferation of piano 'stabs'.\"[1] Modern diva house compositions use synth stabs and four on the floor rhythms.\n\nThe term \"diva house\" was in use as early as July 1992, when Billboard magazine described \"What Are We Doin'\" by Dee Dee Simone as \"iron-lunged diva-house\".[2] It is known for booming unisex vocals, sometimes sampled from other recordings. Such samples come from soul, disco, gospel recordings and even show tunes performed by singers like Bette Midler, Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, and other gay icons. This bombastic genre can include songs performed by dance specialists as well as club remixes of pop songs by singers such as Beyoncé, Cher, Patti LaBelle, Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and Madonna.\n\nThe term \"handbag house\" appears to be particularly popular on British dancefloors and refers to the notion of a group of female club-goers dancing around a pile of their handbags.[3] Dance culture's usage of the word 'handbag house' started life as a derogatory term.\n\nIn the 1990s, as gay clubs and gay culture became more mainstream so did house music. The accessibility of diva house lead to the mainstreaming of gay club music. In the UK especially, handbag house became emblematic of the clubbing culture. According to music historians Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton, by the mid-1990s handbag house had helped to make clubbing into a \"mainstream leisure activity.\"[4] With the mainstreaming of gay culture in the 1990s, \"diva\" was the word that bound house music to the gay dance scene, which was previously only defined by Italo disco compositions.\n\nMusic critic Simon Reynolds asserts that handbag house was \"initially a disparaging term, coined by condescending cognoscenti vis-à-vis the anthemic, chart-penetrating house tunes that allegedly appealed to women, and above all to the folk-mythic construct of Sharon and Tracy.\"[5] According to electronic music producer Ewan Pearson and academic Jeremy Gilbert, \"handbag house\" is often derided as \"plastic disco\" by dance music fans who prefer \"the more esoteric sound of musics which eschew the 'mainstream' musical priorities of melody and verbal language.\"[6] The mainstream appeal of handbag house caused underground dance music purists to flock to the spin-off genres of hardbag, progressive house, deep house, and garage house.[5] Sociologist Dunja Brill argues that criticism of handbag house carries a \"misogynist slant in club cultural representations of the denigrated mainstream of 'Handbag House' against which Ravers define their subculture.\"[7] Brill maintains that bias against handbag house \"is expressed most clearly in a femininisation of the denigrated 'mainstream' of pop culture against which subcultures define themselves.\"[8]"], "reference": "Handbag house is an anthemic subgenre of house music that became most popular in gay clubs during the second half of the 1990s.

{"user_input": "As someone interested in the cultural history of music, what are some of the key characteristics that define Middle Eastern music?", "reference_contexts": ["The various nations of the region include the Arabic-speaking countries of the Middle East, the Iranian traditions of Persia, the Jewish music of Israel and the diaspora, Armenian music. Azeri Music, the varied traditions of Cypriot music, the Turkish music of Turkey, traditional Assyrian music, Coptic ritual music in Egypt as well as other genres of Egyptian music in general. It is widely regarded that some Middle-Eastern musical styles have influenced  Central Asia, as well as the Balkans and Spain.\n\nThroughout the region, religion has been a common factor in uniting peoples of different languages, cultures and nations. The predominance of Islam allowed a great deal of Arabic, and Byzantine influence to spread through the region rapidly from the 7th century onward. The Arabic scale is strongly melodic, often Phrygian Dominant and based on various maqamat (sing. maqam) or modes (also known as makam in Turkish music). The early Arabs translated and developed Greek texts and works of music and mastered the musical theory of the music of ancient Greece (i.e. Systema ametabolon, enharmonium, chromatikon, diatonon).[1] This is similar to the dastgah of Persian music. While this originates with classical music, the modal system has filtered down into folk, liturgical and even popular music, with influence from the West. Unlike much western music, Arabic music includes quarter tones halfway between notes, often through the use of stringed instruments (like the oud) or the human voice. Further distinguishing characteristics of  Middle Eastern and North African music include very complex rhythmic structures, generally tense vocal tone, and a monophonic texture. Traditional Middle Eastern music does not use chords, or harmony in the Western sense.\n\nOften, more traditional Middle-Eastern music can last from one to three hours in length, building up to anxiously awaited, and much applauded climaxes, or tarab, derived from the Arabic term طرب tarraba.[2]\n\nMany instruments originate in the Middle East region. Most popular of the stringed instruments is the oud, a pear-shaped lute that traditionally had four strings, although current instruments have up to six courses consisting of one or two strings each. Legend has it that the oud was invented by Lamech, the sixth grandson of Adam. This is stated by Al-Farabi, and it is part of the Iraqi folklore relating to the instrument. Legend goes on to suggest that the first oud was inspired by the shape of his son's bleached skeleton.[3]\n\nHistorically, the oldest pictorial record of the oud dates back to the Uruk period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago. It is on a cylinder seal currently housed at the British Museum and acquired by Dr. Dominique Collon,[4] Editor of Iraq at the British Institute for the Study of Iraq.[4]\n\nUsed mostly in court music for royals and the rich, the harp also comes from ancient Egypt c. 3500 BC.[5]\n\nThe widespread use of the oud led to many variations on the instrument, including the saz, a Turkish long-necked lute that remains very popular in Turkey.[6]\n\nAnother popular string instrument is the qanoun, developed by Farabi during the Abbasids era. Legend has it that Farabi played qanoun in court and alternately made people laugh, cry, or fall asleep. The qanoun developed out of string instruments described in inscriptions that date to the Assyrian period.[7] It has about 26 triple-string courses, plucked with a piece of horn. The musician has the freedom to alter the pitch of individual courses from a quarter to a whole step by adjusting metal levers.[citation needed]\n\nMiddle Eastern music also makes use of the violin, which is European in origin. The violin was adopted into Middle Eastern music in the 19th century, and it is able to produce non-Western scales that include quarter-tones because it is fretless.[8]\n\nPercussion instruments play a very important role in Middle Eastern music. The complex rhythms of this music are often played on many simple percussion instruments. The riq الرق (a type of tambourine) and finger cymbals add a higher rhythmic line to rhythm laid down with sticks, clappers, and other drums.\n\nAn instrument native to Egypt, the darbuka (both \"tabla\" and \"darbuka\" are its names in Egyptian Arabic), is a drum made of ceramic clay, with a goatskin head glued to the body. The darbuka is used primarily in Egypt, and it has its roots in ancient Egypt. It is also used in other countries in the Middle East.\n\nThe Armenian duduk is a very popular double reeded, oboe-like instrument made out of Apricot tree wood.  The Moroccan oboe, also called the rhaita, has a double-reed mouthpiece that echoes sound down its long and narrow body. A similar instrument is called the sorna. Equivalent to the mizmar and zurna, it is used more for festivals and loud celebrations. A Turkish influence comes from the mey, which has a large double reed. Bamboo reed pipes are the most common background to belly dancing and music from Egypt. Flutes are also a common woodwind instrument in ensembles. A kaval is a three-part flute that is blown in one end,[9] whereas the ney is a long cane flute, played by blowing across the sharp edge while pursing the lips.[10]\n\nMusic pervades Middle Eastern societies.[11] While traditional music remains popular in the Middle East, modern music reconciling Western and traditional Middle Eastern styles, pop, and fusion are rapidly advancing in popularity.[12]"], "reference": "Middle Eastern music is characterized by a strongly melodic Arabic scale, often Phrygian Dominant and based on various maqamat or modes.

The music is more commonly referred to as hardcore, and is characterised by fast beats, distorted and heavy kickdrums, with dark themes and samples. This style was developed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the 1990s[1] by producers like Marc Acardipane, Paul Elstak, DJ Rob, and The Prophet, forming record labels such as Rotterdam Records, Mokum Records, Pengo Records and Industrial Strength Records.\n\nThe word gabber comes from Amsterdam Bargoens slang and means \"friend\".\n\nGabber remains highly popular in the Netherlands, and has seen a major resurgence in recent years.[2] Gabber formed as an underground, anti-establishment movement with small, underground raves, most often illegally held in empty warehouses, basements and tunnels.[3] Rave parties such as Thunderdome, held by ID&T and Mysteryland, became hugely popular, eventually becoming part of mainstream Dutch culture in the 1990s. The music and culture quickly spread across Europe and the world, finding a home with the rave communities in countries such as the UK, Spain, Italy, US, and Australia.\n\nGabber, also known as gabba, early hardcore and Rotterdam hardcore is a style of electronic music and a subgenre of hardcore.[4][5] It was derived from acid house, techno and new beat in the early 1990s.[citation needed] The musical style is described as \"a relentless mix of superfast BPMs, distorted kickdrums, and roared vocals\".[6] The music is generally between 140 and 190 beats per minute with samples taken from films or other tracks.[7] One of the most characteristic components of gabber/early hardcore first appeared in the track \"Anasthasia\" (1991) from T99.[8][9]\n\nThe word gabber comes from an Amsterdam Bargoens slang, based on the Hebrew chaver meaning \"mate\" or \"friend\".[10][5] An Amsterdam DJ was asked about the hard Rotterdam scene and said \"They're just a bunch of gabbers having fun\". Having heard this, Paul Elstak etched in the vinyl on the first Euromasters record (released through Rotterdam Records in 1992), \"Gabber zijn is geen schande!\" ('It's not a disgrace to be a gabber!').[11] The word gained popularity in the Rotterdam music scene and people started to call themselves \"gabbers\".[12]\n\nInfluential early labels were DJ Paul Elstak's Rotterdam Records, Mokum Records in Amsterdam, and Lenny Dee's New York based Industrial Strength Recordings.[13] Alongside Elstak and Dee, other early artists included Marc Acardipane, The Prophet, and Rotterdam Termination Source.[13]\n\nElstak and DJ Rob organised parties first at Parkzicht in Rotterdam and when the numbers attending increased they moved to the Energiehal. ID&T later organised Thunderdome parties for up to 40,000 people.[11] When the sound spread to London in the mid-1990s, Dead by Dawn parties at the 121 Centre in Brixton played gabba, speedcore, and noise.[14] In the Midwestern United States, gabber inspired the foundation of the label Drop Bass Network.[15]\n\nThe popularity of gabber created a youth subculture in the Netherlands. Fashion-wise, gabber ravers wore tracksuits, bomber jackets, and Nike Air Max shoes.[13] Tennis tracksuits from the Italian fashion label Australian by L'Alpina were prized, the tracksuits were often referred to as \"Aussies\".[16] Most men shaved their heads bald, while women braided their hair and shaved the sides. Drug use was common, with ecstasy and speed the popular choices.[17]\n\nLater the look became blouses and short skirts for women.[17] Men wore polo shirts and shirts with jeans and army boots, with a racist minority wearing the Lonsdale brand because of its connection to right-wing extremism.[16] Gabber also had a small following in the German Neo-Nazi fringe movement.[15] In order to repudiate the connection, labels and artists began to release anti-fascist and anti-racist statements. Some examples include \"Chosen Anthem (Against Racism)\" by DJ Chosen Few, \"Die Nazi Scum\" by Party Animals featuring MC Rob Gee, \"Time to Make a Stand\" by United Hardcore, and \"Fuck the Nazism\" by Hellcore.[18] Mokum Records made its slogan (printed on all records): \"Hardcore united against fascism and racism\". Some producers are themselves black, such as The Dark Raver and Loftgroover.[7] When gabber became popular again in the 2000s, Dutch Neo-Nazis attempted to capitalize on it, but their attempts were short-lived.[17]\n\nBy the mid-1990s, gabber had become part of mainstream culture in the Netherlands. Billboard magazine called it the country's \"first homegrown youth culture\" in 1997.[19] Its popularity also led to parody tracks, such as Gabber Piet's \"Hakke & Zage\", which drew on the theme tune of the Peppi & Kokki children's television show.[19] The name also referred to hakken, the style of gabber dancing characterized by fast leg movements that had become popular.[7] Gabber fans were angered by the commercialization of their scene, and Gabber Piet was fired from his job at ID&T. His album Love U Hardcore attempted to make amends but it did not sell well.[19]\n\nThe 2023 film Hardcore Never Dies is set during the 1990s gabber scene in Rotterdam, Netherlands.\n\nWhile the peak of gabber popularity waned in the years after the millennium, there always remained a die-hard few that kept the sound and culture alive. In 2017, Thunderdome celebrated 25 years of hardcore at the Jaarbeurs congress centre in Utrecht. It was attended by 40,000 ravers [13] and was heralded as the official comeback for Thunderdome. The event was the ultimate encapsulation of the history of hardcore, featuring the biggest names in hardcore, showcasing evolution of hardcore music over 25 years from all of the leading hardcore DJs and producers from then and now."], "reference": "Gabber is a style of electronic dance music and a subgenre of hardcore that was developed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the 1990s.

While EBM (electronic body music) has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial tends to have a grittier, complex and layered sound with a more experimental[1] approach. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, Numb, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the dark electro genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the aggrotech offshoot.[2] The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead[2] subculture.\n\nAfter the EBM movement faded in the early 1990s, electro-industrial increasingly attained popularity in the international club scene. In contrast to the straight EBM style, electro-industrial groups use harsher beats and raspy, distorted, or digitized vocals. In contrast to industrial rock, electro-industrial groups mostly avoided guitars, other than Skinny Puppy, who used electric guitar elements since the mid-'80s in songs like \"Testure\" or \"Dig It\",[3] and Numb on songs like \"God Is Dead\".[4]\n\nElectro-industrial was anticipated by 1980s groups such as SPK,[2][5] Die Form, Borghesia, Klinik, Skinny Puppy,[6][7] Numb,[4] and Front Line Assembly.[7][8]\n\nProminent electro-industrial groups of the 1990s include Mentallo and the Fixer, Nine Inch Nails, Yeht Mae, Velvet Acid Christ, and Pulse Legion (U.S.);[9] Numb and Decoded Feedback[10] (Canada); X Marks the Pedwalk, Plastic Noise Experience, Wumpscut,[11][12][13] Haujobb,[14] Forma Tadre, KMFDM, Putrefy Factor 7, and Abortive Gasp[15] (Germany); Leæther Strip[16] (Denmark);[17] and early Hocico, Cenobita, and Amduscia (Mexico).\n\nSince the mid-1990s, some electro-industrial groups added guitars and became associated with industrial metal; other groups, e. g. Skinny Puppy, Download, Gridlock, and Haujobb, have incorporated elements of experimental electronic music styles like drum and bass, IDM, glitch, and other electronica genres.\n\nElectro-industrial groups tend to feature themes of control, dystopia, and science fiction. Electro-industrial groups sometimes take aesthetic inspiration from horror films, including The Exorcist[18] and the work of Roman Polanski,[19]  and the science fiction films Blade Runner and Alien.\n\nDark electro is a similar style, developed in the early 1990s in central Europe. The term describes groups such as yelworC[20] and Placebo Effect,[2] and was first used in December 1992 with the album announcement of Brainstorming, yelworC's debut.[21] The style was inspired by the music of The Klinik and Skinny Puppy. Compositions included gothic horror soundscapes, occult themes, and grunts or distorted vocals. yelworC were a music group from Munich, formed in 1988. They laid the foundations of the dark electro movement in the early 1990s, and were the first artist on the German label Celtic Circle Productions. In subsequent years, dark electro was displaced by techno-influenced styles such as aggrotech and futurepop.[2]  Other groups to practice the style included amGod, Trial, early Evil's Toy, Mortal Constraint, Arcana Obscura, Splatter Squall, Seven Trees, Tri-State, and Ice Ages.\n\nAggrotech (also known as hellektro)[2] is a derivative form of dark-electro with a strong influence from industrial hardcore (straight techno bassdrum from Roland TR-909 and oscillator sounds, especially Supersaw leads from Roland JP-8000) that first surfaced in the mid- to late-1990s.\n\nAggrotech typically employs aggressive beats, prominent lead synth lines, and lyrics of a dark nature.  Often, vocals are distorted and pitch-shifted to sound harsh and synthetic; static and glitching effects are also added. Aggrotech musicians include Agonoize, Amduscia, Bestias De Asalto, Combichrist, Dawn of Ashes, Detroit Diesel, Feindflug, God Module, Grendel, Hocico, iVardensphere, Nachtmahr, Panic Lift, Psyclon Nine, Reaper, Suicide Commando, The Retrosic, Ritual Aesthetic, Unter Null, Virtual Embrace, and X-Fusion, among many."], "reference": "Electro-industrial is a music genre that emerged from industrial music in the early 1980s.
