It has a trombone-like mouthpiece, with six tone holes arranged in two groups of three fingered by each hand. It is named for its long, conical bore bent into a snakelike shape, and unlike most brass instruments is made from wood with an outer covering of leather. A distant ancestor of the tuba, the serpent is related to the cornett and was used for bass parts from the 17th to the early 19th centuries.[4] In the early 19th century, keys were added to improve intonation, and several upright variants were developed and used, until they were superseded first by the ophicleide and ultimately by the valved tuba. After almost entirely disappearing from orchestras, the serpent experienced a renewed interest in historically informed performance practice in the mid-20th century. Several contemporary works have been commissioned and composed, and serpents are again made by a small number of contemporary manufacturers. The sound of a serpent is somewhere between a bassoon and a euphonium, and it is typically played in a seated position, with the instrument resting upright between the player's knees. Construction[edit] Although closely related to the cornett, the serpent has thinner walls, a more conical bore, and no thumb-hole.[5] The original serpent was typically built from hardwood, usually walnut or other tonewoods like maple, cherry, or pear, or sometimes softer woods like poplar. In France, the instrument was made from bonding two double-S-shaped halves, each carved from a single large piece of wood. In England, it was usually made from several smaller curved tubular wooden segments, each made by gluing two hollowed halves together. The whole instrument was then glued and bound with an outer covering of leather.[6] A small number were made instead from copper or brass; one brass serpent in the Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica in Bologna was built in 1773 with an added outer layer of leather.[7] The instrument uses a mouthpiece about the same size as a trombone mouthpiece, originally made from ivory, horn or hardwood. The cup profiles of most historical serpent and bass horn mouthpieces were a distinctly hemispherical or ovate bowl shape, with a sharper-edged and narrower \"throat\" at the bottom of the cup than modern trombone mouthpieces, before expanding more-or-less conically through the shank.[8] The mouthpiece fits into the bocal or crook, a small length of brass tubing that emerges from the top wooden segment.[6] The serpent has six tone holes, in two groups of three, fingered by each hand.[6] It is initially challenging to play the instrument with good intonation, due in large part to the positions of the tone holes.[9] They are arranged mainly to be accessible to the player's fingers, rather than in acoustically correct positions, which for some of them would be out of reach.[10][11] The lower tone holes are too small to act effectively to shorten the air column, but by dampening resonances they nevertheless aid note selection and contribute to the serpent's characteristic soft timbre.[12] While early serpents were keyless, later instruments added keys for additional holes out of reach of the fingers to improve intonation, and extend range.[6] A mid-19th century model by London instrument maker Thomas Key has 14 keys, and survives in St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff, Wales.[13] Modern replicas are made by several specialist instrument makers, employing acoustic analysis and modern fabrication materials and techniques to further improve the serpent's intonation. Some of these techniques include use of modern composite materials and polymers, 3D printing, and changing the placement of tone holes.[3] Swiss serpent maker Stephan Berger in collaboration with French jazz musician Michel Godard has developed an improved serpent based on studying well-preserved museum instruments, and also makes a lightweight model from carbon fibre.[14] English serpent player and musicologist Clifford Bevan remarked that Berger's instruments are much improved, finally allowing players to approach the serpent \"in partnership rather than in combat\".[10]"], "reference": "The serpent is related to the cornett.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "Who were Joseph and Richard Wood?", "reference_contexts": ["Sizes[edit] Douglas Yeo with serpents in four sizes, from largest to smallest: contrabass, bass, tenor, and soprano The majority of surviving specimens in museums and private collections are nominally bass serpents built in eight-foot (8′) C, thus having a total tubing length of about 8 feet (2.4 m). A few slightly smaller specimens were built in D, and military serpents could sometimes vary in pitch between D♭ and B♭.[9] The tenor serpent (or serpet; French: serpenteau) arose in the 1960s when English early music specialist and instrument maker Christopher Monk began his efforts to produce modern reproduction serpents by first building a half-sized pattern, which equated to a tenor size in 4′ C. Through a pantographic milling process, he scaled up the pattern by 2× to carve a bass serpent. Since he could just as easily carve at 1×, he was also able to produce tenor serpents popular in serpent ensembles, and usable by players with smaller fingers. The soprano serpent, or worm, was built by scaling the tenor serpent by 0.5× to produce an instrument in 2′ C, two octaves higher than the standard serpent. It first appeared in the 1980s, made as a novelty instrument by Monk.[15][16] There is no repertoire or other evidence of the historical existence of these sizes. Contrabass serpent, c. 1840. St Cecilia's Hall, University of Edinburgh[17] The contrabass serpent, nicknamed the anaconda and built in 16′ C one octave below the serpent, was an English invention of the mid-19th century with no historical repertoire.[18] The prototype instrument was built c. 1840 by Joseph and Richard Wood in Huddersfield as a double-sized English military serpent, and survives in the University of Edinburgh museum collection.[19][17] Its use of keys, progressively larger tone holes, and an open top tone hole make it essentially a wooden, serpent-shaped contrabass ophicleide.[20] During the serpent's modern revival, two more contrabass serpents were built in the original serpent ordinaire form in the 1990s by Christopher Monk's workshop, by doubling the pattern for a bass serpent. They were called \"George\" and \"George II\".[16] The first, commissioned by musicologist and serpent player Philip Palmer, was owned by American trombonist and serpent player Douglas Yeo for a time and features in some of his serpent recordings.[21] At least four other contrabass serpents have also been built: one from PVC piping in 1986, two from box plywood based on a \"squarpent\" design by American serpent player and curator Paul Schmidt, and one in 2014 from spare tuba and sousaphone parts.[22] History[edit] There is little direct material or documentary evidence for the exact origin of the serpent. French historian Jean Lebeuf claimed in his 1743 work Mémoires Concernant l'Histoire Ecclésiastique et Civile d’Auxerre that the serpent was invented in 1590 by Edmé Guillaume, a clergyman in Auxerre, France, which is generally accepted.[23] Some scholars propose that the serpent may have evolved from large, curved bass cornetts that were in use in Italy in the 16th century,[24] but the lack of knowledge of the serpent in early 17th century Italy, or surviving early serpents outside of France, counts against this idea.[25] The serpent was certainly used in France since the early 17th century, to strengthen the cantus firmus and bass voices of choirs in plainchant.[26] This original traditional serpent was known as the serpent ordinaire or serpent d'église (lit. 'ordinary serpent' or 'church serpent'). Around the middle of the 18th century, the serpent began to appear in military bands, chamber ensembles, and later in orchestras. In England, particularly in the south, the serpent was used in west gallery music played in Church of England parish churches and village bands until the mid 19th century.[27]"], "reference": "The prototype contrabass serpent was built c. 1840 by Joseph and Richard Wood in Huddersfield as a double-sized English military serpent.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "Given my interest in historical oboes and wind instruments, can you elaborate on the development and use of upright serpents, particularly the basson russe, and its connection to France during the 19th century?", "reference_contexts": ["Upright serpents and bass horns[edit] Types of upright serpents and bass horns Top left: basson russe, c. 1825–40; right: English bass horn, c. 1835; bottom, left: cimbasso, early 19th century; right: Serpent Forveille, c. 1825 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) Several vertical configurations of the serpent, generally known as upright serpents (French: serpent droit) or bass horns, were developed from the late 18th century. Retaining the same six tone holes and fingering of the original serpent, these instruments resemble the bassoon, with jointed straight tubes that fit into a short U-shaped butt joint, and an upward-pointing bell.[4] Basson russe[edit] Among the first of the upright serpents to appear around the turn of the 19th century was the basson russe, lit. 'Russian bassoon', although it was neither Russian nor a bassoon. The name is possibly a corruption of basson prusse since they were taken up by the Prussian army bands of the time.[28] Many of these instruments were built in Lyon and often had the buccin-style decorative zoomorphic bells popular in France at the time, shaped and painted like a dragon or serpent head.[4] Appearing around the same time in military bands was the serpent à pavillon (lit. 'bell serpent') which had a normal brass instrument bell, similar in flare to the later ophicleide.[29] English bass horn[edit] The English bass horn, developed by London-based French musician and inventor Louis Alexandre Frichot in 1799, had an all-metal V-shaped construction, described by German composer Felix Mendelssohn as resembling a watering can. He admired its sound however, and wrote for the instrument in several of his works, including the overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and his fifth \"Reformation\" symphony (1830),[4] although when the Overture was first published, the part was changed to ophicleide for unknown reasons.[30] The bass horn was popular in civic and military bands in Britain and Ireland, and also spread back into orchestras in Europe, where it influenced the inventors of both the ophicleide and later the Baß-Tuba.[31] Early cimbasso[edit] The serpent appears as serpentone in early 19th century Italian operatic scores by composers such as Spontini, Rossini, and Bellini.[32] In Italy it was replaced by the cimbasso, a loose term that referred to several instruments; initially an upright serpent similar to the basson russe, then the ophicleide, early forms of valved tuba (pelittone, bombardone), and finally by the time of Verdi's opera Otello (1887), a valve contrabass trombone.[33] Other upright serpents[edit] In Paris in 1823, Forveille invented his eponymous serpent Forveille, an upright serpent with an enlarged bell section influenced by the (then newly invented) ophicleide. It is distinguished by being made from wood, brass tubing being used only for the leadpipe and first bend.[34] It became popular in bands for its improved intonation and sound quality.[4] In 1828 Jean-Baptiste Coëffet patented his ophimonocleide (\"snake with one key\"), one of the last forms of the upright serpent.[32] It solved a perennial problem of the serpent, its difficult and indistinct B♮ notes. The instrument is built a semitone lower in B♮ and adds a large open tone hole that keeps the instrument in C until its key is pressed, closing the tone hole and producing a clear and resonant B♮. The instrument also has a unique pompe, a double tuning slide that (combined with adjusting the bocal) could change the pitch by up to a major second and allow the player to switch between the different pitch standards of the time (diapason de l'opéra and diapason de la cathédrale).[35] Contemporary revival[edit] The London Serpent Trio, 1989: Andrew van der Beek (left), Christopher Monk (center), Alan Lumsden (right) The era of upright serpents was brief, spanning the first half of the 19th century from their invention to their replacement by the ophicleide and subsequent valved brass instruments.[36] German opera composer Richard Wagner, by the 1869 première of his Der Ring des Nibelungen cycle, was writing his lowest brass parts for tuba and contrabass trombone.[37] Consequently, the serpent had all but disappeared from ensembles by 1900. The serpent has enjoyed a modern revival of interest and manufacture since the mid-20th century. Christopher Monk began building his own replica cornetts and serpents and playing them in historically informed performances. In 1968 he and instrument maker Keith Rogers devised a method of constructing cornetts inexpensively from a composite wood-resin material, which helped to raise interest in these instruments and increase their availability. In 1976 he established the London Serpent Trio with English Early Music Consort players Andrew van der Beek and Alan Lumsden, performing new works and historical arrangements, both serious and whimsical, throughout Europe and North America.[38][39] At the same time in France, historical instrument specialist Bernard Fourtet and jazz musician Michel Godard began promoting use of the serpent, and reintroduced serpent teaching at the Conservatoire de Paris.[40] Among the graduates are Volny Hostiou, who has recorded a significant serpent discography, and Patrick Wibart, also an accomplished ophicleide player.[41][42] Wibart succeeded Godard as the serpent teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris, and also teaches serpent at the Conservatoire de Versailles Grand Parc [fr].[43] The Serpent Newsletter, first published in 1986 as the Newsletter for United Serpents, is published twice a year and edited by Paul Schmidt. It reviews new recordings and publications, covers contemporary performances and events, as well as new discoveries, appearances in media and film, and other developments.[44] Range and performance[edit] Range of the serpent; notes below C₂ are obtained with the embouchure[2] The serpent's range typically covers the two and a half octaves from C2 two octaves below middle C to G4. The range can easily extend downwards to A1 or even F1 by fingering the low C note with all holes covered, and producing falset tones, by slackening the embouchure (\"lipping down\"). Proficient players can play upwards to C5.[45] Monk writes that due to its inherent mechanical and acoustical defects, the serpent is one of the more difficult wind instruments to play well.[46] Although played with an embouchure similar to that used with other brass instruments such"], "reference": "Several vertical configurations of the serpent, known as upright serpents (French: serpent droit) or bass horns, were developed from the late 18th century.

{"user_input": "Did Gioacchino Rosini use the serpent in any of his operas?", "reference_contexts": ["as the trombone, the instrument is easily over-blown so the player must use a more gentle air stream. The tone holes do not always serve to shorten the air column as they do in woodwind instruments. The lower tone holes in particular are too small and behave more like air leaks, working largely by dampening resonances in the air column, thus altering the note selection and influencing the timbre.[12] Consequently, the player must rely much more on a strong, controlled embouchure to produce the correct pitch than on other brass instruments. The serpent's natural tones with all holes covered (the harmonic series on C2) are fuller and richer than those produced with fingering, so the player must also focus on consistency of timbre and a cantabile approach throughout the serpent's range.[46] Serpentist holding the instrument horizontally, with reversed right-hand fingering The serpent was originally played vertically, with each hand covering one of the two sets of tone holes from above. In 1772 Abbé Lunel, serpentist at Notre-Dame de Paris, devised a way to hold the serpent horizontally, a method subsequently used in military bands.[47] Holding the serpent this way involves supporting the lower curve with the right hand under, rather than over, the lower three tone holes, thus reversing the order of the fingering.[48] Production of pitch can be lowered by a semitone or more by slackening the embouchure given the same fingering. This is due to the serpent's coupling of a \"strong\" acoustical system of embouchure and mouthpiece, with the relatively \"weak\" system of the air column in the serpent body. This results in the mouthpiece having a stronger influence on selecting the instrument pitch than the air column.[49] The mismatch of embouchure and air column length also contributes to its timbre.[12] Repertoire[edit] Michel Godard performs on a serpent in the Adrabesa Quartet, 2020. Note, Godard is using the vertical hold. Serpents were originally used as an instrument to accompany church choral music, particularly in France. For this purpose, very little was specifically written for the serpent per se; the serpent player would simply play the cantus firmus, or bass line.[23] The serpent began to be called for in orchestras by opera composers in the mid-to-late 18th century, and their subsequent adoption in military bands prompted the publication of several method books, fingering charts and etudes, including duets for student and teacher.[50] Among the serpent's first appearances in orchestral scores is George Frideric Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks (1749), although he later removed it. Italian composers in the early 19th century often called for serpentone, in operas by Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini. Mendelssohn paired serpent with contrabassoon in his 1828 overture Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage and fifth \"Reformation\" symphony (1830), and Hector Berlioz included serpent and ophicleide in his early revisions of Symphonie fantastique (1830). After disappearing almost entirely by the late 19th century, the serpent began to reappear in the mid-20th century in film scores and new period instrument chamber ensembles. American film composer Bernard Herrmann used a serpent in the scores of White Witch Doctor (1953) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), as did Jerry Goldsmith in his score for Alien (1979).[51] In jazz, French tubist Michel Godard has incorporated the serpent into his music, and has frequently collaborated with Lebanese composer and oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil.[52] Modern works for the instrument include a concerto for serpent and orchestra by English composer Simon Proctor, commissioned in 1987 to mark the first International Serpent Festival in South Carolina, where it was premièred by London Serpent Trio member Alan Lumsden in 1989.[51][53] Also premièred at the festival was composer Peter Schickele's comic P.D.Q. Bach piece \"O Serpent\" written for the London Serpent Trio and an ensemble of vocalists.[54][55] Douglas Yeo premièred \"Temptation\" for serpent and string quartet, written by his Boston Symphony Orchestra colleague, trombonist and composer Norman Bolter, at the 1999 International Trombone Festival in Potsdam, New York.[56][57] Yeo also premièred a serpent concerto in 2008 by American composer Gordon W. Bowie entitled \"Old Dances in New Shoes\".[58] Italian composer Luigi Morleo wrote \"Diversità: NO LIMIT\", a concerto for serpent and strings, which premièred in Monopoli, Italy in 2012.[59] American composer Austin Wintory's Grammy-nominated and BAFTA-winning soundtrack for the 2012 PlayStation 3 video game Journey includes a serpent as one of the five soloists, played by Noah Gladstone.[60] Players[edit] Clifford Bevan, London Serpent Trio, musicologist[61] Bernard Fourtet, French early music specialist Michel Godard, Conservatoire de Paris; jazz musician, tubist, serpent player Volny Hostiou, scholar and serpent specialist[62][41] Phil Humphries, London Serpent Trio, New London Consort[61] Andrew Kershaw, London Serpent Trio, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment[63] Alan Lumsden, London Serpent Trio, Early Music Consort Nick Perry, London Serpent Trio, serpent builder for Christopher Monk Instruments[63] Andrew van der Beek, London Serpent Trio, Early Music Consort Patrick Wibart, Conservatoire de Paris, Conservatoire de Versailles Grand Parc [fr]; serpent and ophicleide specialist[64] Steve Wick, tubist, professor of Serpent at Royal Academy of Music, London Serpent Trio[61] Douglas Yeo, Boston Symphony Orchestra (retired), bass trombonist, serpent and ophicleide player In popular culture[edit] The prop used for the titular horn in the 1956 British film The Case of the Mukkinese Battle-Horn was based on a serpent.[65] A prop was used in the 1999 film of A Christmas Carol starring Patrick Stewart.

The musical instrument known as the regal or regalle (from Middle French régale[1]) is a small portable organ, furnished with beating reeds and having two bellows.[2] The instrument enjoyed its greatest popularity during the Renaissance. The name \"regal\" was also sometimes given to the reed stops of a pipe organ, and more especially to the vox humana stop.", "<2-hop>\n\nHistory[edit] The sound of the regal is produced by brass reeds held in resonators.[2] The length of the vibrating portion of the reed determines its pitch and is regulated by means of a wire passing through the socket, the other end pressing on the reed at the proper distance. The resonators in the regal are not intended to reinforce the vibrations of the beating reed or of its overtones (as in the reed pipes of the organ), but merely to form an attachment to keep the reed in place without interfering with its function. A common compass was C/E--c′′′ (four octaves, with a short octave in the bass), though this was by no means standardized. Most regals were placed on a table to be played, and required two people—one to play the instrument, and another to pump the bellows. Bible Regal c. 1800, from St. Cecilias Hall Museum, Edinburgh Michael Praetorius (1618) mentions a larger regal used in the court orchestras of some of the German princes, more like a positive organ, containing reeds at 4′, 8′, and even sometimes 16′ pitch, and having two bellows behind the case. These regals were used not only at banquets but often in place of positive organs in churches. A very small regal, sometimes called a Bible regal because it could be separated into sections and folded up like a book, was also mentioned by the same writer, who stated that these little instruments had an unpleasantly harsh tone due to their tiny resonators, which were not quite an inch long. He states that they were first made in Nuremberg and Augsburg. In England and France, the word \"regal\" was sometimes applied to reed stops on the organ; Mersenne (1636) states that the word was applied at that time to the vox humana stop.[2] According to Praetorius, the reed stops of pipe organs required constant tuning; he emphasized the fact that the pitch of the stop fell in summer and rose in winter. The pitch of the other stops rose in summer and fell in winter. Because of civil wars and the ravages of time, very few antique regals survive. They were often mentioned in wills and inventories, such as the list of Henry VIII's musical instruments made after his death by Sir Philip Wilder (British Library Harley MS 1415, fol. 200 seq.), in which no fewer than thirteen pairs of single and five pairs of double regals are mentioned (although at that period, \"pair\" referred to a single instrument). Claudio Monteverdi scored for the regals in his operas, and the instrument was described and illustrated by Sebastian Virdung in 1511, Martin Agricola in 1528, and Othmar Luscinius in 1536. In England, as late as the reign of George III, there was the appointment of tuner of the regals to the Chapel Royal. Drawings of the reeds of regals and other reed pipes, as well as of the instrument itself, are given by Praetorius (pl. iv., xxxviii.).

It has a trombone-like mouthpiece, with six tone holes arranged in two groups of three fingered by each hand. It is named for its long, conical bore bent into a snakelike shape, and unlike most brass instruments is made from wood with an outer covering of leather. A distant ancestor of the tuba, the serpent is related to the cornett and was used for bass parts from the 17th to the early 19th centuries.[4] In the early 19th century, keys were added to improve intonation, and several upright variants were developed and used, until they were superseded first by the ophicleide and ultimately by the valved tuba. After almost entirely disappearing from orchestras, the serpent experienced a renewed interest in historically informed performance practice in the mid-20th century. Several contemporary works have been commissioned and composed, and serpents are again made by a small number of contemporary manufacturers. The sound of a serpent is somewhere between a bassoon and a euphonium, and it is typically played in a seated position, with the instrument resting upright between the player's knees. Construction[edit] Although closely related to the cornett, the serpent has thinner walls, a more conical bore, and no thumb-hole.[5] The original serpent was typically built from hardwood, usually walnut or other tonewoods like maple, cherry, or pear, or sometimes softer woods like poplar. In France, the instrument was made from bonding two double-S-shaped halves, each carved from a single large piece of wood. In England, it was usually made from several smaller curved tubular wooden segments, each made by gluing two hollowed halves together. The whole instrument was then glued and bound with an outer covering of leather.[6] A small number were made instead from copper or brass; one brass serpent in the Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica in Bologna was built in 1773 with an added outer layer of leather.[7] The instrument uses a mouthpiece about the same size as a trombone mouthpiece, originally made from ivory, horn or hardwood. The cup profiles of most historical serpent and bass horn mouthpieces were a distinctly hemispherical or ovate bowl shape, with a sharper-edged and narrower \"throat\" at the bottom of the cup than modern trombone mouthpieces, before expanding more-or-less conically through the shank.[8] The mouthpiece fits into the bocal or crook, a small length of brass tubing that emerges from the top wooden segment.[6] The serpent has six tone holes, in two groups of three, fingered by each hand.[6] It is initially challenging to play the instrument with good intonation, due in large part to the positions of the tone holes.[9] They are arranged mainly to be accessible to the player's fingers, rather than in acoustically correct positions, which for some of them would be out of reach.[10][11] The lower tone holes are too small to act effectively to shorten the air column, but by dampening resonances they nevertheless aid note selection and contribute to the serpent's characteristic soft timbre.[12] While early serpents were keyless, later instruments added keys for additional holes out of reach of the fingers to improve intonation, and extend range.[6] A mid-19th century model by London instrument maker Thomas Key has 14 keys, and survives in St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff, Wales.[13] Modern replicas are made by several specialist instrument makers, employing acoustic analysis and modern fabrication materials and techniques to further improve the serpent's intonation. Some of these techniques include use of modern composite materials and polymers, 3D printing, and changing the placement of tone holes.[3] Swiss serpent maker Stephan Berger in collaboration with French jazz musician Michel Godard has developed an improved serpent based on studying well-preserved museum instruments, and also makes a lightweight model from carbon fibre.[14] English serpent player and musicologist Clifford Bevan remarked that Berger's instruments are much improved, finally allowing players to approach the serpent \"in partnership rather than in combat\".[10]", "<5-hop>\n\nas the trombone, the instrument is easily over-blown so the player must use a more gentle air stream.

The lower tone holes in particular are too small and behave more like air leaks, working largely by dampening resonances in the air column, thus altering the note selection and influencing the timbre.[12] Consequently, the player must rely much more on a strong, controlled embouchure to produce the correct pitch than on other brass instruments. The serpent's natural tones with all holes covered (the harmonic series on C2) are fuller and richer than those produced with fingering, so the player must also focus on consistency of timbre and a cantabile approach throughout the serpent's range.[46] Serpentist holding the instrument horizontally, with reversed right-hand fingering The serpent was originally played vertically, with each hand covering one of the two sets of tone holes from above. In 1772 Abbé Lunel, serpentist at Notre-Dame de Paris, devised a way to hold the serpent horizontally, a method subsequently used in military bands.[47] Holding the serpent this way involves supporting the lower curve with the right hand under, rather than over, the lower three tone holes, thus reversing the order of the fingering.[48] Production of pitch can be lowered by a semitone or more by slackening the embouchure given the same fingering. This is due to the serpent's coupling of a \"strong\" acoustical system of embouchure and mouthpiece, with the relatively \"weak\" system of the air column in the serpent body. This results in the mouthpiece having a stronger influence on selecting the instrument pitch than the air column.[49] The mismatch of embouchure and air column length also contributes to its timbre.[12] Repertoire[edit] Michel Godard performs on a serpent in the Adrabesa Quartet, 2020. Note, Godard is using the vertical hold. Serpents were originally used as an instrument to accompany church choral music, particularly in France. For this purpose, very little was specifically written for the serpent per se; the serpent player would simply play the cantus firmus, or bass line.[23] The serpent began to be called for in orchestras by opera composers in the mid-to-late 18th century, and their subsequent adoption in military bands prompted the publication of several method books, fingering charts and etudes, including duets for student and teacher.[50] Among the serpent's first appearances in orchestral scores is George Frideric Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks (1749), although he later removed it. Italian composers in the early 19th century often called for serpentone, in operas by Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini. Mendelssohn paired serpent with contrabassoon in his 1828 overture Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage and fifth \"Reformation\" symphony (1830), and Hector Berlioz included serpent and ophicleide in his early revisions of Symphonie fantastique (1830). After disappearing almost entirely by the late 19th century, the serpent began to reappear in the mid-20th century in film scores and new period instrument chamber ensembles. American film composer Bernard Herrmann used a serpent in the scores of White Witch Doctor (1953) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), as did Jerry Goldsmith in his score for Alien (1979).[51] In jazz, French tubist Michel Godard has incorporated the serpent into his music, and has frequently collaborated with Lebanese composer and oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil.[52] Modern works for the instrument include a concerto for serpent and orchestra by English composer Simon Proctor, commissioned in 1987 to mark the first International Serpent Festival in South Carolina, where it was premièred by London Serpent Trio member Alan Lumsden in 1989.[51][53] Also premièred at the festival was composer Peter Schickele's comic P.D.Q. Bach piece \"O Serpent\" written for the London Serpent Trio and an ensemble of vocalists.[54][55] Douglas Yeo premièred \"Temptation\" for serpent and string quartet, written by his Boston Symphony Orchestra colleague, trombonist and composer Norman Bolter, at the 1999 International Trombone Festival in Potsdam, New York.[56][57] Yeo also premièred a serpent concerto in 2008 by American composer Gordon W. Bowie entitled \"Old Dances in New Shoes\".[58] Italian composer Luigi Morleo wrote \"Diversità: NO LIMIT\", a concerto for serpent and strings, which premièred in Monopoli, Italy in 2012.[59] American composer Austin Wintory's Grammy-nominated and BAFTA-winning soundtrack for the 2012 PlayStation 3 video game Journey includes a serpent as one of the five soloists, played by Noah Gladstone.[60] Players[edit] Clifford Bevan, London Serpent Trio, musicologist[61] Bernard Fourtet, French early music specialist Michel Godard, Conservatoire de Paris; jazz musician, tubist, serpent player Volny Hostiou, scholar and serpent specialist[62][41] Phil Humphries, London Serpent Trio, New London Consort[61] Andrew Kershaw, London Serpent Trio, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment[63] Alan Lumsden, London Serpent Trio, Early Music Consort Nick Perry, London Serpent Trio, serpent builder for Christopher Monk Instruments[63] Andrew van der Beek, London Serpent Trio, Early Music Consort Patrick Wibart, Conservatoire de Paris, Conservatoire de Versailles Grand Parc [fr]; serpent and ophicleide specialist[64] Steve Wick, tubist, professor of Serpent at Royal Academy of Music, London Serpent Trio[61] Douglas Yeo, Boston Symphony Orchestra (retired), bass trombonist, serpent and ophicleide player In popular culture[edit] The prop used for the titular horn in the 1956 British film The Case of the Mukkinese Battle-Horn was based on a serpent.[65] A prop was used in the 1999 film of A Christmas Carol starring Patrick Stewart.

{"user_input": "Considering the shawm's eventual decline in popularity, what other instruments, such as the serpent (instrument), were used for bass parts in ensembles, and what characteristics did these instruments possess that made them suitable for indoor performances where the shawm was less preferred?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nDouble reed woodwind instrument ShawmClassification Double reedRelated instruments Sorna Rhaita Aulos Suona Sopila Zurna Shepherd playing the shawm (1646), by Jan Baptist Wolffort (Dutch Rijksmuseum) The shawm (/ʃɔːm/) is a conical bore, double-reed woodwind instrument made in Europe from the 12th century to the present day. It achieved its peak of popularity during the medieval and Renaissance periods, after which it was gradually eclipsed by the oboe family of descendant instruments in classical music. It is likely to have come to Western Europe from the Eastern Mediterranean around the time of the Crusades.[1] Double-reed instruments similar to the shawm were long present in Southern Europe and the East, for instance the ancient Greek, and later Byzantine aulos,[2][3] the closely related sorna and zurna,[4] and the Armenian duduk. The body of the shawm is usually turned from a single piece of wood, and terminates in a flared bell somewhat like that of a trumpet. Beginning in the 16th century, shawms were made in several sizes, from sopranino to great bass, and four- and five-part music could be played by a consort consisting entirely of shawms. All later shawms (excepting the smallest) have at least one key allowing a downward extension of the compass; the keywork is typically covered by a perforated wooden cover called the fontanelle.[citation needed] The bassoon-like double reed, made from the same arundo donax cane used for oboes and bassoons, is inserted directly into a socket at the top of the instrument, or in the larger types, on the end of a metal tube called the bocal. The pirouette, a small wooden attachment with a cavity in the center resembling a thimble, surrounds the lower part of the reed—this provides support for the lips and embouchure.[5] Since only a short portion of the reed protrudes past the pirouette, the player has only limited contact with the reed, and therefore limited control of dynamics. The shawm's conical bore and flaring bell, combined with the style of playing dictated by the use of a pirouette, gives the instrument a piercing, trumpet-like sound, well-suited for outdoor performances. Etymology[edit] Pipita and Zampogna in Calabria (Italy) In English the name first appears in the 14th century. There were originally three main variant forms, (1) schallemele (shamulle or shamble), (2) s(c)halmys (shalemeyes or chalemyes, all plural forms in Middle English), and (3) sc(h)almuse (or schalmesse), each derived from a corresponding variant in Old French: chalemel, chalemie, and chalemeaux (the plural of chalemel), each in turn derived from the Latin calamus ('reed'), or its Vulgar Latin diminutive form, calamellus. Calamus, in turn, derives from Ancient Greek κάλαμος (kálamos), \"reed, cane\". (The name of a somewhat different reed instrument, the chalumeau, also shares this etymology.) The early plural forms were often mistaken for a singular, and new plurals were formed from them. The later reduction in the 15th and 16th centuries to a single syllable in forms such as schalme, shaume, shawme, and finally (in the 16th century) shawm, was probably due to this confusion of plural and singular forms.[6] Shawms (from Syntagma Musicum by Michael Praetorius) In German the shawm is called Schalmei (or for the larger members of the family Bombard—also in English in the 14th century—later corrupted to Bombhardt and finally in the 17th century to Pommer)[7] This is borne out by the very similar names of many folk shawms used as traditional instruments in various European nations: in Spain, many traditional shawms with different names can be found, such as the Castilian, Aragonese, and Leonese dulzaina (sometimes called chirimía, a term that derives from the same Old French word as shawm); the Valencian and Catalan shawms (xirimia, dolçaina, or gralla) or the Navarrese gaita. In Portugal there is an instrument called charamela; and the name of the Italian shawm is ciaramella (or: cialamello, cennamella).[8] However, it is also possible that the name comes from the Arabic ‹See RfD› salamiya (سلامية‎), a traditional oboe from Egypt, as the European shawm seems to have been developed from similar instruments brought to Europe from the Near East during the time of the Crusades. This Arabic name is itself linguistically related to many other Eastern names for the instrument: the Arabic ‹See RfD› zamr (زمر), the Turkish zūrnā, the Persian surnāy, the Chinese suona, the Javanese saruni, and the Hindu ‹See RfD› sahanai or sanayi.[4]", "<2-hop>\n\nUse[edit] Woman playing a bass shawm (Tobias Stimmer c. 1500) By the early 16th century the brash tonality of the medieval shawm had been modulated by a narrowing of the bore and a reduction in the size of the fingerholes. This also extended the range, enabling the performer to play the notes in the second octave. Larger sizes of shawm were built, down to the great bass in B♭, two octaves and a major third below the soprano in D. However, the larger sizes were unwieldy, which made them somewhat rare. The smaller sizes of shawm, chiefly the soprano, alto and sometimes the tenor, were more often coupled with the Renaissance trombone, or sackbut, and the majestic sound of this ensemble was much in demand by civic authorities. The shawm became standard equipment for town bands, or waits, who were required to herald the start of municipal functions and signal the major times of day. The shawm became so closely associated with the town waits (die Stadtpfeifer in German and I pifferi in Italian) that it was also known as the wait-pipe. 1615, Brussels. Procession of musicians, three with shawms. Before the discovery of a still shawm aboard the shipwreck of the Mary Rose, instrument historians had been puzzled by references to \"still shawms\", or \"soft\" shawms, that were said to have a sound that was less shrill than earlier shawms.[9] The still shawm disappeared from the musical scene in the 16th century; the instrument found on the Mary Rose is the only surviving example. A reproduction has been made and played. Combined with a pipe and tabor, it provides a \"very effective bass part\" that would have produced \"rich and full sound, which would have provided excellent music for dancing on board ship\".[10] The shawm was reserved almost exclusively for outdoor performance—for softer, indoor music, other instruments such as the crumhorn and cornamuse were preferred. These were double reed instruments fitted with a capsule that completely enclosed the reed, which softened the sound but still did not allow for any variation in dynamics. Known by the Spanish term chirimia, the shawm remains an important ritual instrument among Maya peoples of Highland Guatemala. Accompanied by a drum, the chirimia is frequently used in processions and in certain ritual dances, such as the Dance of the Conquest (Baile de la Conquista), and this is still played today. Progeny of the shawm[edit] A tenor shawm in C with a single key [without the customary lower extension to G], with a range of a perfect twelfth, was described as a nicolo according to Michael Praetorius in his Syntagma Musicum II (1619), pages 23 and 36, but was not illustrated. Praetorius does, however, illustrate in Plate 13 in the supplementary volume of illustrations, the Theatrum instrumentorum (1620), along with crumhorns, a bassett:nicolo which has the outward appearance of a capped shawm with four keys, but in fact conceals a mostly cylindrical bore. (The range of the bassett: nicolo descended to the A below great C and was just over four feet in length; a shawm of this range, i.e., with a conical bore, would require more than 9 feet of bore length.)[citation needed]", "<3-hop>\n\nOboe[edit] The shawm inspired the later 17th-century hautbois, an invention of the French musician Martin Hotteterre (d. 1712). He is credited with devising essentially a brand-new instrument, one which borrowed several features from the shawm, chiefly its double reed and conical bore, but departed from it significantly in other respects, the most important departure being the fact the player places his lips directly on the reed with no intervening pirouette. Around 1670, the new French hautbois began replacing the shawm in military bands, concert music and opera; by 1700, the shawm had all but disappeared from concert life, although as late as 1830 shawms could still be heard in German town bands performing their municipal functions.[11] Curiously, the Germans and Dutch continued to manufacture an ornate version of the shawm, called deutsche Schalmey, well after the introduction of the French hautbois. Several examples of this instrument survive in European collections, although its exact musical use is unclear.[citation needed] Dulcian/bassoon[edit] The 16th-century proclivity for building instruments in a full range of sizes was naturally extended to the shawm, but the extreme length of pipe of the bass instruments meant that few were built and played, due to their cumbersome size.[citation needed] A solution was devised whereby the bore was in effect \"folded back\" upon itself, creating a much more manageable instrument. The new instrument is often referred to as the dulcian, and was called curtal in England,[12] fagott or fagotto in Germany and Italy, and bajón in Spain.[citation needed] The dulcian, like the first oboes, employed direct lip-to-reed contact, which allowed for much greater control over the sound than was offered by shawms. This led to the dulcian becoming very popular, serving as a bass both to the other shawms and even to indoor ensembles that did not feature shawms, afforded by its ability to play quietly. The dulcian was the forerunner to the bassoon, which like the oboe was a Baroque invention.[citation needed] Charumera[edit] The charumera (チャルメラ), or charumeru (チャルメル), is a double-reed instrument in traditional Japanese music descended either from shawms brought to Japan by Portuguese Christian missionaries,[13] or possibly Iberian traders in the 16th century.[14] It is sometimes used in kabuki theatre performances. It is also strongly associated in popular culture with street vendors of ramen, who played a distinctive melody on it to attract customers.

It has a trombone-like mouthpiece, with six tone holes arranged in two groups of three fingered by each hand. It is named for its long, conical bore bent into a snakelike shape, and unlike most brass instruments is made from wood with an outer covering of leather. A distant ancestor of the tuba, the serpent is related to the cornett and was used for bass parts from the 17th to the early 19th centuries.[4] In the early 19th century, keys were added to improve intonation, and several upright variants were developed and used, until they were superseded first by the ophicleide and ultimately by the valved tuba. After almost entirely disappearing from orchestras, the serpent experienced a renewed interest in historically informed performance practice in the mid-20th century. Several contemporary works have been commissioned and composed, and serpents are again made by a small number of contemporary manufacturers. The sound of a serpent is somewhere between a bassoon and a euphonium, and it is typically played in a seated position, with the instrument resting upright between the player's knees. Construction[edit] Although closely related to the cornett, the serpent has thinner walls, a more conical bore, and no thumb-hole.[5] The original serpent was typically built from hardwood, usually walnut or other tonewoods like maple, cherry, or pear, or sometimes softer woods like poplar. In France, the instrument was made from bonding two double-S-shaped halves, each carved from a single large piece of wood. In England, it was usually made from several smaller curved tubular wooden segments, each made by gluing two hollowed halves together. The whole instrument was then glued and bound with an outer covering of leather.[6] A small number were made instead from copper or brass; one brass serpent in the Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica in Bologna was built in 1773 with an added outer layer of leather.[7] The instrument uses a mouthpiece about the same size as a trombone mouthpiece, originally made from ivory, horn or hardwood. The cup profiles of most historical serpent and bass horn mouthpieces were a distinctly hemispherical or ovate bowl shape, with a sharper-edged and narrower \"throat\" at the bottom of the cup than modern trombone mouthpieces, before expanding more-or-less conically through the shank.[8] The mouthpiece fits into the bocal or crook, a small length of brass tubing that emerges from the top wooden segment.[6] The serpent has six tone holes, in two groups of three, fingered by each hand.[6] It is initially challenging to play the instrument with good intonation, due in large part to the positions of the tone holes.[9] They are arranged mainly to be accessible to the player's fingers, rather than in acoustically correct positions, which for some of them would be out of reach.[10][11] The lower tone holes are too small to act effectively to shorten the air column, but by dampening resonances they nevertheless aid note selection and contribute to the serpent's characteristic soft timbre.[12] While early serpents were keyless, later instruments added keys for additional holes out of reach of the fingers to improve intonation, and extend range.[6] A mid-19th century model by London instrument maker Thomas Key has 14 keys, and survives in St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff, Wales.[13] Modern replicas are made by several specialist instrument makers, employing acoustic analysis and modern fabrication materials and techniques to further improve the serpent's intonation. Some of these techniques include use of modern composite materials and polymers, 3D printing, and changing the placement of tone holes.[3] Swiss serpent maker Stephan Berger in collaboration with French jazz musician Michel Godard has developed an improved serpent based on studying well-preserved museum instruments, and also makes a lightweight model from carbon fibre.[14] English serpent player and musicologist Clifford Bevan remarked that Berger's instruments are much improved, finally allowing players to approach the serpent \"in partnership rather than in combat\".[10]", "<5-hop>\n\nas the trombone, the instrument is easily over-blown so the player must use a more gentle air stream. The tone holes do not always serve to shorten the air column as they do in woodwind instruments. The lower tone holes in particular are too small and behave more like air leaks, working largely by dampening resonances in the air column, thus altering the note selection and influencing the timbre.[12] Consequently, the player must rely much more on a strong, controlled embouchure to produce the correct pitch than on other brass instruments. The serpent's natural tones with all holes covered (the harmonic series on C2) are fuller and richer than those produced with fingering, so the player must also focus on consistency of timbre and a cantabile approach throughout the serpent's range.[46] Serpentist holding the instrument horizontally, with reversed right-hand fingering The serpent was originally played vertically, with each hand covering one of the two sets of tone holes from above. In 1772 Abbé Lunel, serpentist at Notre-Dame de Paris, devised a way to hold the serpent horizontally, a method subsequently used in military bands.[47] Holding the serpent this way involves supporting the lower curve with the right hand under, rather than over, the lower three tone holes, thus reversing the order of the fingering.[48] Production of pitch can be lowered by a semitone or more by slackening the embouchure given the same fingering. This is due to the serpent's coupling of a \"strong\" acoustical system of embouchure and mouthpiece, with the relatively \"weak\" system of the air column in the serpent body. This results in the mouthpiece having a stronger influence on selecting the instrument pitch than the air column.[49] The mismatch of embouchure and air column length also contributes to its timbre.[12] Repertoire[edit] Michel Godard performs on a serpent in the Adrabesa Quartet, 2020. Note, Godard is using the vertical hold. Serpents were originally used as an instrument to accompany church choral music, particularly in France. For this purpose, very little was specifically written for the serpent per se; the serpent player would simply play the cantus firmus, or bass line.[23] The serpent began to be called for in orchestras by opera composers in the mid-to-late 18th century, and their subsequent adoption in military bands prompted the publication of several method books, fingering charts and etudes, including duets for student and teacher.[50] Among the serpent's first appearances in orchestral scores is George Frideric Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks (1749), although he later removed it. Italian composers in the early 19th century often called for serpentone, in operas by Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini. Mendelssohn paired serpent with contrabassoon in his 1828 overture Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage and fifth \"Reformation\" symphony (1830), and Hector Berlioz included serpent and ophicleide in his early revisions of Symphonie fantastique (1830). After disappearing almost entirely by the late 19th century, the serpent began to reappear in the mid-20th century in film scores and new period instrument chamber ensembles. American film composer Bernard Herrmann used a serpent in the scores of White Witch Doctor (1953) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), as did Jerry Goldsmith in his score for Alien (1979).[51] In jazz, French tubist Michel Godard has incorporated the serpent into his music, and has frequently collaborated with Lebanese composer and oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil.[52] Modern works for the instrument include a concerto for serpent and orchestra by English composer Simon Proctor, commissioned in 1987 to mark the first International Serpent Festival in South Carolina, where it was premièred by London Serpent Trio member Alan Lumsden in 1989.[51][53] Also premièred at the festival was composer Peter Schickele's comic P.D.Q. Bach piece \"O Serpent\" written for the London Serpent Trio and an ensemble of vocalists.[54][55] Douglas Yeo premièred \"Temptation\" for serpent and string quartet, written by his Boston Symphony Orchestra colleague, trombonist and composer Norman Bolter, at the 1999 International Trombone Festival in Potsdam, New York.[56][57] Yeo also premièred a serpent concerto in 2008 by American composer Gordon W. Bowie entitled \"Old Dances in New Shoes\".[58] Italian composer Luigi Morleo wrote \"Diversità: NO LIMIT\", a concerto for serpent and strings, which premièred in Monopoli, Italy in 2012.[59] American composer Austin Wintory's Grammy-nominated and BAFTA-winning soundtrack for the 2012 PlayStation 3 video game Journey includes a serpent as one of the five soloists, played by Noah Gladstone.[60] Players[edit] Clifford Bevan, London Serpent Trio, musicologist[61] Bernard Fourtet, French early music specialist Michel Godard, Conservatoire de Paris; jazz musician, tubist, serpent player Volny Hostiou, scholar and serpent specialist[62][41] Phil Humphries, London Serpent Trio, New London Consort[61] Andrew Kershaw, London Serpent Trio, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment[63] Alan Lumsden, London Serpent Trio, Early Music Consort Nick Perry, London Serpent Trio, serpent builder for Christopher Monk Instruments[63] Andrew van der Beek, London Serpent Trio, Early Music Consort Patrick Wibart, Conservatoire de Paris, Conservatoire de Versailles Grand Parc [fr]; serpent and ophicleide specialist[64] Steve Wick, tubist, professor of Serpent at Royal Academy of Music, London Serpent Trio[61] Douglas Yeo, Boston Symphony Orchestra (retired), bass trombonist, serpent and ophicleide player In popular culture[edit] The prop used for the titular horn in the 1956 British film The Case of the Mukkinese Battle-Horn was based on a serpent.[65] A prop was used in the 1999 film of A Christmas Carol starring Patrick Stewart.

Of these, the bass ophicleide in eight-foot (8′) C or 9′ B♭ took root over the course of the 19th century in military bands and as the bass of orchestral brass sections throughout Western Europe, replacing the serpent and its later upright derivatives. By the end of the 19th century, however, it had been largely superseded by early forms of the modern tuba, developed from valved ophicleides.[2] Etymology[edit] The instrument's name comes from the Greek words ὄφις (ophis, lit. 'serpent') and κλείς (kleis, lit. 'closure'), since it was conceived of as a serpent with keys.[3]", "<2-hop>\n\nHistory[edit] The ophicleide was patented in 1821 by French instrument maker Jean Hilaire Asté (operating as Halary) as a set of instruments to extend the keyed bugle into lower registers. The patent originally included an alto instrument called the quinticlave, built in six-foot (6′) F or 6½′ E♭, and the (nominally bass) ophicleide in 8′ C or 9′ B♭. The alto was always a rare instrument, only appearing in military bands for a time, before being superseded by valved instruments.[3] A very rare contrabass in 12′ F or 13′ E♭, known in France as the monstre, was commissioned in 1834 for Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah, and later played by French musician Prospère in performances in France and England. Four known historical instruments survive, all in F in non-playable condition in museums.[4] The only known playable contrabasses are two replicas in E♭ built since the late 1980s by Californian instrument maker Robb Stewart.[5] Adolphe Sax built examples of a soprano ophicleide an octave above the bass in the 1840s, and playable replicas have also been built by Stewart, including a smaller instrument in E♭.[6][7] It was the bass ophicleide that became the bass of the brass section of the early Romantic orchestra (with the exception of the symphonic tradition in German-speaking countries), replacing the Renaissance-era serpent and its later upright derivatives.[3] The bass ophicleide first appeared in the banda (stage band) of the opera Olimpie by Gaspare Spontini in 1819.[8] Other famous works which employ it include Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah and Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (originally scored for English bass horn), as well as Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which was originally scored to include both an ophicleide and a serpent. Today, it is often replaced with two tubas in modern orchestral performances, but some writers believe the original effect is lost; the tubas are too loud for the intended sound.[9] The instrument was standard in French mid-19th century serious operas by Meyerbeer, Halevy, and Auber, as well as English operas by Michael Balfe, Vincent Wallace, and others. Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi scored for either serpentone or cimbasso in his early operas, but parts were often played on the ophicleide until the appearance of the trombone basso Verdi in the late 1880s.[10] Composers Saverio Mercadante and Richard Wagner also composed for the ophicleide, before switching to the bass tuba or contrabass trombone. Sir Arthur Sullivan included ophicleide in his Overture Di Ballo (which, like Wagner's opera Rienzi, also has an additional part for serpent).[11] The ophicleide (Portuguese: oficleide) was used in Brazilian choro bands well into the 20th century until it was superseded by the saxophone.[12] pt:Irineu de Almeida was a major soloist on the instrument. A revival of interest in the instrument took place in Britain the late 20th century, beginning with David Rycroft in 1965 and further involving players Alan Lumsden, Stephen Wick and Cliff Bevan, who were also involved in reviving the serpent.[13] In the early 2000s the London Ophicleide Ensemble was established. Australian trombonist Nick Byrne has commissioned and recorded works for the ophicleide, including a concerto by American composer William Perry.[14] Titled Brass From the Past, it was premiered in 2012 and later recorded by Naxos Records with Byrne as soloist.[15]", "<3-hop>\n\nPlaying range Range of bass ophicleide in C[1]Related instruments Keyed bugleSerpentSudrophoneEuphoniumTubaMusicians Cliff BevanNick ByrneJean Prosper GuiverSam HughesAlan LumsdenDavid RycroftStephen Wick Hudson Graham's collection of ophicleides, including soprano (left) and contrabass (right) replica instruments by Robb Stewart The ophicleide (/ˈɒfɪklaɪd/ OFF-ih-klyde) is a family of conical-bore keyed brass instruments invented in early 19th-century France to extend the keyed bugle into the alto, bass and contrabass ranges.

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The ophicleide's tubing has a similar length and arrangement as that of the upright serpents that preceded it, bending back on itself in a similar manner to the bassoon. It is played with a cup-shaped mouthpiece similar to a modern trombone or euphonium mouthpiece.[13] It originally had nine keys, but later expanded to up to eleven keys with twelve holes (double hole for the E), covering the large tone holes.[16] The taper of the ophicleide's wide conical bore is similar to a saxophone of comparable range, with only a modest bell flare compared to other brass instruments. Later in the 19th century, soon after the invention of brass instrument valves, instruments with the same overall layout but replacing keys with valves appeared. These instruments were called valved ophicleides (German: Ventilophikleide; French: ophicléide à piston).[16] Use[edit] The ophicleide was eventually succeeded by the tuba, although it remained popular in Italy until the early twentieth century. The euphonium can also be called a successor instrument. One of the last great ophicleide players was the English musician Sam Hughes. There have been claims that the instrument was a direct ancestor of the saxophone: supposedly Adolphe Sax, while repairing an ophicleide, put a woodwind mouthpiece on the instrument and liked the sound, allegedly leading Sax to design and create a purpose-built instrument. However, this story is not considered plausible, since the developmental history of the saxophone is well documented and the ophicleide and saxophone are only superficially similar to each other in that both have a wide conical bore and large tone holes. A powerful bass reed organ stop is named after the ophicleide. Playing[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

These instruments were called valved ophicleides (German: Ventilophikleide; French: ophicléide à piston).[16]  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The ophicleide, like the smaller keyed bugle it was derived from, has a fingering system unlike other wind instruments. All keys except one are normally closed, opening only when a finger presses the associated key lever. Just below the bell is the largest of the key-covered tone holes, which is normally open, closing only when the lever is pressed. This normally open tone hole is the acoustic bell, with the bell itself having little effect on sound or pitch. The sound produced with no key levers pressed is the nominal pitch of the instrument. If the player presses the lever for this normally open tone hole, that hole is closed and the now-longer air column extends past this hole up to the bell, lowering the pitch by one half step. In general, the player can obtain all the \"partial\" pitches available for a given air column length. To play a higher series of partials, they open one of the normally closed tone holes, effectively making that hole the \"bell\" of the instrument, with a corresponding shorter air column and higher series of pitches. The left hand controls three such tone holes plus the normally open one below the bell. Pitches in the upper and middle range of the instrument can be obtained by using only the left hand's set of tone holes, and the right hand can hold and stabilize the instrument. At the point where the air column is shortened by opening all of the left hand tone holes, there comes a difficult couple of notes that can best be played by continuing to shorten the air column with two fingers of the right hand, before the series of partials \"wraps\" and the left hand is used again for another set of notes. In the lowest octave, some pitches cannot be obtained very well using the holes closer to the bell. For these notes, the other fingers of the right hand can open a few more tone holes that are relatively closer to the mouthpiece than to the bell. Some instruments were made with between one and three extra right hand keys to provide better intonation for specific notes in this register. The right hand keys may also be used in the upper registers as alternate fingerings to facilitate faster passages or to improve intonation. With the exception of these special few pitches in the low octave, the combinations of partials on various sets of opened tone holes results in the left hand fingers going through something very similar to what they would be doing to manipulate the valves on a modern brass instrument.", "<5-hop>\n\nUpright serpents and bass horns[edit] Types of upright serpents and bass horns Top left: basson russe, c. 1825–40; right: English bass horn, c. 1835; bottom, left: cimbasso, early 19th century; right: Serpent Forveille, c. 1825 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) Several vertical configurations of the serpent, generally known as upright serpents (French: serpent droit) or bass horns, were developed from the late 18th century. Retaining the same six tone holes and fingering of the original serpent, these instruments resemble the bassoon, with jointed straight tubes that fit into a short U-shaped butt joint, and an upward-pointing bell.[4] Basson russe[edit] Among the first of the upright serpents to appear around the turn of the 19th century was the basson russe, lit. 'Russian bassoon', although it was neither Russian nor a bassoon. The name is possibly a corruption of basson prusse since they were taken up by the Prussian army bands of the time.[28] Many of these instruments were built in Lyon and often had the buccin-style decorative zoomorphic bells popular in France at the time, shaped and painted like a dragon or serpent head.[4] Appearing around the same time in military bands was the serpent à pavillon (lit. 'bell serpent') which had a normal brass instrument bell, similar in flare to the later ophicleide.[29] English bass horn[edit] The English bass horn, developed by London-based French musician and inventor Louis Alexandre Frichot in 1799, had an all-metal V-shaped construction, described by German composer Felix Mendelssohn as resembling a watering can. He admired its sound however, and wrote for the instrument in several of his works, including the overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and his fifth \"Reformation\" symphony (1830),[4] although when the Overture was first published, the part was changed to ophicleide for unknown reasons.[30] The bass horn was popular in civic and military bands in Britain and Ireland, and also spread back into orchestras in Europe, where it influenced the inventors of both the ophicleide and later the Baß-Tuba.[31] Early cimbasso[edit] The serpent appears as serpentone in early 19th century Italian operatic scores by composers such as Spontini, Rossini, and Bellini.[32] In Italy it was replaced by the cimbasso, a loose term that referred to several instruments; initially an upright serpent similar to the basson russe, then the ophicleide, early forms of valved tuba (pelittone, bombardone), and finally by the time of Verdi's opera Otello (1887), a valve contrabass trombone.[33] Other upright serpents[edit] In Paris in 1823, Forveille invented his eponymous serpent Forveille, an upright serpent with an enlarged bell section influenced by the (then newly invented) ophicleide. It is distinguished by being made from wood, brass tubing being used only for the leadpipe and first bend.[34] It became popular in bands for its improved intonation and sound quality.[4] In 1828 Jean-Baptiste Coëffet patented his ophimonocleide (\"snake with one key\"), one of the last forms of the upright serpent.[32] It solved a perennial problem of the serpent, its difficult and indistinct B♮ notes. The instrument is built a semitone lower in B♮ and adds a large open tone hole that keeps the instrument in C until its key is pressed, closing the tone hole and producing a clear and resonant B♮. The instrument also has a unique pompe, a double tuning slide that (combined with adjusting the bocal) could change the pitch by up to a major second and allow the player to switch between the different pitch standards of the time (diapason de l'opéra and diapason de la cathédrale).[35] Contemporary revival[edit] The London Serpent Trio, 1989: Andrew van der Beek (left), Christopher Monk (center), Alan Lumsden (right) The era of upright serpents was brief, spanning the first half of the 19th century from their invention to their replacement by the ophicleide and subsequent valved brass instruments.[36] German opera composer Richard Wagner, by the 1869 première of his Der Ring des Nibelungen cycle, was writing his lowest brass parts for tuba and contrabass trombone.[37] Consequently, the serpent had all but disappeared from ensembles by 1900. The serpent has enjoyed a modern revival of interest and manufacture since the mid-20th century. Christopher Monk began building his own replica cornetts and serpents and playing them in historically informed performances. In 1968 he and instrument maker Keith Rogers devised a method of constructing cornetts inexpensively from a composite wood-resin material, which helped to raise interest in these instruments and increase their availability. In 1976 he established the London Serpent Trio with English Early Music Consort players Andrew van der Beek and Alan Lumsden, performing new works and historical arrangements, both serious and whimsical, throughout Europe and North America.[38][39] At the same time in France, historical instrument specialist Bernard Fourtet and jazz musician Michel Godard began promoting use of the serpent, and reintroduced serpent teaching at the Conservatoire de Paris.[40] Among the graduates are Volny Hostiou, who has recorded a significant serpent discography, and Patrick Wibart, also an accomplished ophicleide player.[41][42] Wibart succeeded Godard as the serpent teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris, and also teaches serpent at the Conservatoire de Versailles Grand Parc [fr].[43] The Serpent Newsletter, first published in 1986 as the Newsletter for United Serpents, is published twice a year and edited by Paul Schmidt. It reviews new recordings and publications, covers contemporary performances and events, as well as new discoveries, appearances in media and film, and other developments.[44] Range and performance[edit] Range of the serpent; notes below C₂ are obtained with the embouchure[2] The serpent's range typically covers the two and a half octaves from C2 two octaves below middle C to G4. The range can easily extend downwards to A1 or even F1 by fingering the low C note with all holes covered, and producing falset tones, by slackening the embouchure (\"lipping down\"). Proficient players can play upwards to C5.[45] Monk writes that due to its inherent mechanical and acoustical defects, the serpent is one of the more difficult wind instruments to play well.[46] Although played with an embouchure similar to that used with other brass instruments such", "<6-hop>\n\nLIMIT\".

The patent originally included an alto instrument called the quinticlave, built in six-foot (6′) F or 6½′ E♭, and the (nominally bass) ophicleide in 8′ C or 9′ B♭. The alto was always a rare instrument, only appearing in military bands for a time, before being superseded by valved instruments.[3] A very rare contrabass in 12′ F or 13′ E♭, known in France as the monstre, was commissioned in 1834 for Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah, and later played by French musician Prospère in performances in France and England. Four known historical instruments survive, all in F in non-playable condition in museums.[4] The only known playable contrabasses are two replicas in E♭ built since the late 1980s by Californian instrument maker Robb Stewart.[5] Adolphe Sax built examples of a soprano ophicleide an octave above the bass in the 1840s, and playable replicas have also been built by Stewart, including a smaller instrument in E♭.[6][7] It was the bass ophicleide that became the bass of the brass section of the early Romantic orchestra (with the exception of the symphonic tradition in German-speaking countries), replacing the Renaissance-era serpent and its later upright derivatives.[3] The bass ophicleide first appeared in the banda (stage band) of the opera Olimpie by Gaspare Spontini in 1819.[8] Other famous works which employ it include Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah and Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (originally scored for English bass horn), as well as Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which was originally scored to include both an ophicleide and a serpent. Today, it is often replaced with two tubas in modern orchestral performances, but some writers believe the original effect is lost; the tubas are too loud for the intended sound.[9] The instrument was standard in French mid-19th century serious operas by Meyerbeer, Halevy, and Auber, as well as English operas by Michael Balfe, Vincent Wallace, and others. Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi scored for either serpentone or cimbasso in his early operas, but parts were often played on the ophicleide until the appearance of the trombone basso Verdi in the late 1880s.[10] Composers Saverio Mercadante and Richard Wagner also composed for the ophicleide, before switching to the bass tuba or contrabass trombone. Sir Arthur Sullivan included ophicleide in his Overture Di Ballo (which, like Wagner's opera Rienzi, also has an additional part for serpent).[11] The ophicleide (Portuguese: oficleide) was used in Brazilian choro bands well into the 20th century until it was superseded by the saxophone.[12] pt:Irineu de Almeida was a major soloist on the instrument. A revival of interest in the instrument took place in Britain the late 20th century, beginning with David Rycroft in 1965 and further involving players Alan Lumsden, Stephen Wick and Cliff Bevan, who were also involved in reviving the serpent.[13] In the early 2000s the London Ophicleide Ensemble was established. Australian trombonist Nick Byrne has commissioned and recorded works for the ophicleide, including a concerto by American composer William Perry.[14] Titled Brass From the Past, it was premiered in 2012 and later recorded by Naxos Records with Byrne as soloist.[15]", "<3-hop>\n\nPlaying range Range of bass ophicleide in C[1]Related instruments Keyed bugleSerpentSudrophoneEuphoniumTubaMusicians Cliff BevanNick ByrneJean Prosper GuiverSam HughesAlan LumsdenDavid RycroftStephen Wick Hudson Graham's collection of ophicleides, including soprano (left) and contrabass (right) replica instruments by Robb Stewart The ophicleide (/ˈɒfɪklaɪd/ OFF-ih-klyde) is a family of conical-bore keyed brass instruments invented in early 19th-century France to extend the keyed bugle into the alto, bass and contrabass ranges.

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The ophicleide's tubing has a similar length and arrangement as that of the upright serpents that preceded it, bending back on itself in a similar manner to the bassoon. It is played with a cup-shaped mouthpiece similar to a modern trombone or euphonium mouthpiece.[13] It originally had nine keys, but later expanded to up to eleven keys with twelve holes (double hole for the E), covering the large tone holes.[16] The taper of the ophicleide's wide conical bore is similar to a saxophone of comparable range, with only a modest bell flare compared to other brass instruments. Later in the 19th century, soon after the invention of brass instrument valves, instruments with the same overall layout but replacing keys with valves appeared. These instruments were called valved ophicleides (German: Ventilophikleide; French: ophicléide à piston).[16] Use[edit] The ophicleide was eventually succeeded by the tuba, although it remained popular in Italy until the early twentieth century. The euphonium can also be called a successor instrument. One of the last great ophicleide players was the English musician Sam Hughes. There have been claims that the instrument was a direct ancestor of the saxophone: supposedly Adolphe Sax, while repairing an ophicleide, put a woodwind mouthpiece on the instrument and liked the sound, allegedly leading Sax to design and create a purpose-built instrument. However, this story is not considered plausible, since the developmental history of the saxophone is well documented and the ophicleide and saxophone are only superficially similar to each other in that both have a wide conical bore and large tone holes. A powerful bass reed organ stop is named after the ophicleide. Playing[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

These instruments were called valved ophicleides (German: Ventilophikleide; French: ophicléide à piston).[16]  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The ophicleide, like the smaller keyed bugle it was derived from, has a fingering system unlike other wind instruments. All keys except one are normally closed, opening only when a finger presses the associated key lever. Just below the bell is the largest of the key-covered tone holes, which is normally open, closing only when the lever is pressed. This normally open tone hole is the acoustic bell, with the bell itself having little effect on sound or pitch. The sound produced with no key levers pressed is the nominal pitch of the instrument. If the player presses the lever for this normally open tone hole, that hole is closed and the now-longer air column extends past this hole up to the bell, lowering the pitch by one half step. In general, the player can obtain all the \"partial\" pitches available for a given air column length. To play a higher series of partials, they open one of the normally closed tone holes, effectively making that hole the \"bell\" of the instrument, with a corresponding shorter air column and higher series of pitches. The left hand controls three such tone holes plus the normally open one below the bell. Pitches in the upper and middle range of the instrument can be obtained by using only the left hand's set of tone holes, and the right hand can hold and stabilize the instrument. At the point where the air column is shortened by opening all of the left hand tone holes, there comes a difficult couple of notes that can best be played by continuing to shorten the air column with two fingers of the right hand, before the series of partials \"wraps\" and the left hand is used again for another set of notes. In the lowest octave, some pitches cannot be obtained very well using the holes closer to the bell. For these notes, the other fingers of the right hand can open a few more tone holes that are relatively closer to the mouthpiece than to the bell. Some instruments were made with between one and three extra right hand keys to provide better intonation for specific notes in this register. The right hand keys may also be used in the upper registers as alternate fingerings to facilitate faster passages or to improve intonation. With the exception of these special few pitches in the low octave, the combinations of partials on various sets of opened tone holes results in the left hand fingers going through something very similar to what they would be doing to manipulate the valves on a modern brass instrument.", "<5-hop>\n\nWoodwind instrument RecorderVarious recorders (second from the bottom disassembled into its three parts)WoodwindOther namesSee § Other languagesClassification Wind Woodwind Aerophone Hornbostel–Sachs classification421.221.12(Flute with internal duct and finger holes)Playing range Soprano recorder: C5–D7(G7)Related instruments Tin whistle Flageolet Csakan Three-hole pipe Musicians Recorder players The recorder is a family of woodwind musical instruments in the group known as internal duct flutes: flutes with a whistle mouthpiece, also known as fipple flutes, although this is an archaic term. A recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of a thumb-hole for the upper hand and seven finger-holes: three for the upper hand and four for the lower. It is the most prominent duct flute in the western classical tradition.[1] Recorders are made in various sizes with names and compasses roughly corresponding to various vocal ranges. The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (also known as descant, lowest note C5), alto (also known as treble, lowest note F4), tenor (lowest note C4), and bass (lowest note F3). Recorders were traditionally constructed from wood or ivory. Modern professional instruments are almost invariably of wood, often boxwood; student and scholastic recorders are commonly of moulded plastic. The recorders' internal and external proportions vary, but the bore is generally reverse conical (i.e. tapering towards the foot) to cylindrical, and all recorder fingering systems make extensive use of forked fingerings. The recorder is first documented in Europe in the Middle Ages, and continued to enjoy wide popularity in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but was little used in the Classical and Romantic periods. It was revived in the twentieth century as part of the historically informed performance movement, and became a popular amateur and educational instrument. Composers who have written for the recorder include Monteverdi, Lully, Purcell, Handel, Vivaldi, Telemann, Bach, Hindemith, and Berio.[2] There are many professional recorder players who demonstrate the full solo range of the instrument, and a large community of amateurs.[3] The sound of the recorder is often described as clear and sweet,[2] and has historically been associated with birds and shepherds. It is notable for its quick response and its corresponding ability to produce a wide variety of articulations. This ability, coupled with its open finger holes, allow it to produce a wide variety of tone colours and special effects. Acoustically, its tone is relatively pure and, when the edge is positioned in the center of the airjet, odd harmonics predominate in its sound (when the edge is decidedly off-center, an even distribution of harmonics occurs).[4][2] Name[edit] The instrument has been known by its modern English name at least since the fourteenth century. David Lasocki reports the earliest use of \"recorder\" in the household accounts of the Earl of Derby (later King Henry IV) in 1388, which register i. fistula nomine Recordour (one pipe called 'Recordour').[5] By the fifteenth century, the name had appeared in English literature. The earliest references are in John Lydgate's Temple of Glas (c. 1430): These lytylle herdegromys Floutyn al the longe day..In here smale recorderys, In floutys. ('These little shepherds fluting all day long ... on these small recorders, on flutes.')[6] and in Lydgate's Fall of Princes (c. 1431–1438): Pan, god off Kynde, with his pipes seuene, / Off recorderis fond first the melodies. ('Pan, god of Nature, with his pipes seven, / of recorders found first the melodies.')[7][8]"], "reference": "The ophicleide is a keyed brass instrument invented in early 19th-century France, designed to extend the keyed bugle into lower registers, eventually being superseded by the tuba. While there have been claims of a connection to the saxophone due to similar bore and tone hole characteristics, the developmental history of the saxophone is well-documented, making a direct link implausible. The recorder, on the other hand, is a woodwind instrument, specifically an internal duct flute, documented in Europe since the Middle Ages and experiencing a revival in the 20th century. The ophicleide's tubing arrangement is similar to upright serpents, and it is played with a cup-shaped mouthpiece, while the recorder is played with a whistle mouthpiece. Therefore, the ophicleide and the recorder are distinct instruments with different construction and historical trajectories, with no direct relationship between them.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer"}

Four known historical instruments survive, all in F in non-playable condition in museums.[4] The only known playable contrabasses are two replicas in E♭ built since the late 1980s by Californian instrument maker Robb Stewart.[5] Adolphe Sax built examples of a soprano ophicleide an octave above the bass in the 1840s, and playable replicas have also been built by Stewart, including a smaller instrument in E♭.[6][7] It was the bass ophicleide that became the bass of the brass section of the early Romantic orchestra (with the exception of the symphonic tradition in German-speaking countries), replacing the Renaissance-era serpent and its later upright derivatives.[3] The bass ophicleide first appeared in the banda (stage band) of the opera Olimpie by Gaspare Spontini in 1819.[8] Other famous works which employ it include Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah and Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (originally scored for English bass horn), as well as Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which was originally scored to include both an ophicleide and a serpent. Today, it is often replaced with two tubas in modern orchestral performances, but some writers believe the original effect is lost; the tubas are too loud for the intended sound.[9] The instrument was standard in French mid-19th century serious operas by Meyerbeer, Halevy, and Auber, as well as English operas by Michael Balfe, Vincent Wallace, and others. Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi scored for either serpentone or cimbasso in his early operas, but parts were often played on the ophicleide until the appearance of the trombone basso Verdi in the late 1880s.[10] Composers Saverio Mercadante and Richard Wagner also composed for the ophicleide, before switching to the bass tuba or contrabass trombone. Sir Arthur Sullivan included ophicleide in his Overture Di Ballo (which, like Wagner's opera Rienzi, also has an additional part for serpent).[11] The ophicleide (Portuguese: oficleide) was used in Brazilian choro bands well into the 20th century until it was superseded by the saxophone.[12] pt:Irineu de Almeida was a major soloist on the instrument. A revival of interest in the instrument took place in Britain the late 20th century, beginning with David Rycroft in 1965 and further involving players Alan Lumsden, Stephen Wick and Cliff Bevan, who were also involved in reviving the serpent.[13] In the early 2000s the London Ophicleide Ensemble was established. Australian trombonist Nick Byrne has commissioned and recorded works for the ophicleide, including a concerto by American composer William Perry.[14] Titled Brass From the Past, it was premiered in 2012 and later recorded by Naxos Records with Byrne as soloist.[15] Construction[edit] Valved ophicleide built c. 1838–40 by Leopold Uhlmann, Vienna. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The ophicleide's tubing has a similar length and arrangement as that of the upright serpents that preceded it, bending back on itself in a similar manner to the bassoon. It is played with a cup-shaped mouthpiece similar to a modern trombone or euphonium mouthpiece.[13] It originally had nine keys, but later expanded to up to eleven keys with twelve holes (double hole for the E), covering the large tone holes.[16] The taper of the ophicleide's wide conical bore is similar to a saxophone of comparable range, with only a modest bell flare compared to other brass instruments. Later in the 19th century, soon after the invention of brass instrument valves, instruments with the same overall layout but replacing keys with valves appeared. These instruments were called valved ophicleides (German: Ventilophikleide; French: ophicléide à piston).[16] Use[edit] The ophicleide was eventually succeeded by the tuba, although it remained popular in Italy until the early twentieth century. The euphonium can also be called a successor instrument. One of the last great ophicleide players was the English musician Sam Hughes. There have been claims that the instrument was a direct ancestor of the saxophone: supposedly Adolphe Sax, while repairing an ophicleide, put a woodwind mouthpiece on the instrument and liked the sound, allegedly leading Sax to design and create a purpose-built instrument. However, this story is not considered plausible, since the developmental history of the saxophone is well documented and the ophicleide and saxophone are only superficially similar to each other in that both have a wide conical bore and large tone holes. A powerful bass reed organ stop is named after the ophicleide. Playing[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(May 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The ophicleide, like the smaller keyed bugle it was derived from, has a fingering system unlike other wind instruments. All keys except one are normally closed, opening only when a finger presses the associated key lever. Just below the bell is the largest of the key-covered tone holes, which is normally open, closing only when the lever is pressed. This normally open tone hole is the acoustic bell, with the bell itself having little effect on sound or pitch. The sound produced with no key levers pressed is the nominal pitch of the instrument. If the player presses the lever for this normally open tone hole, that hole is closed and the now-longer air column extends past this hole up to the bell, lowering the pitch by one half step. In general, the player can obtain all the \"partial\" pitches available for a given air column length. To play a higher series of partials, they open one of the normally closed tone holes, effectively making that hole the \"bell\" of the instrument, with a corresponding shorter air column and higher series of pitches. The left hand controls three such tone holes plus the normally open one below the bell. Pitches in the upper and middle range of the instrument can be obtained by using only the left hand's set of tone holes, and the right hand can hold and stabilize the instrument. At the point where the air column is shortened by opening all of the left hand tone holes, there comes a difficult couple of notes that can best be played by continuing to shorten the air column with two fingers of the right hand, before the series of partials \"wraps\" and the left hand is used again for another set of notes. In the lowest octave, some pitches cannot be obtained very well using the holes closer to the bell. For these notes, the other fingers of the right hand can open a few more tone holes that are relatively closer to the mouthpiece than to the bell. Some instruments were made with between one and three extra right hand keys to provide better intonation for specific notes in this register. The right hand keys may also be used in the upper registers as alternate fingerings to facilitate faster passages or to improve intonation. With the exception of these special few pitches in the low octave, the combinations of partials on various sets of opened tone holes results in the left hand fingers going through something very similar to what they would be doing to manipulate the valves on a modern brass instrument.", "<5-hop>\n\nUpright serpents and bass horns[edit] Types of upright serpents and bass horns Top left: basson russe, c. 1825–40; right: English bass horn, c. 1835; bottom, left: cimbasso, early 19th century; right: Serpent Forveille, c. 1825 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) Several vertical configurations of the serpent, generally known as upright serpents (French: serpent droit) or bass horns, were developed from the late 18th century. Retaining the same six tone holes and fingering of the original serpent, these instruments resemble the bassoon, with jointed straight tubes that fit into a short U-shaped butt joint, and an upward-pointing bell.[4] Basson russe[edit] Among the first of the upright serpents to appear around the turn of the 19th century was the basson russe, lit. 'Russian bassoon', although it was neither Russian nor a bassoon. The name is possibly a corruption of basson prusse since they were taken up by the Prussian army bands of the time.[28] Many of these instruments were built in Lyon and often had the buccin-style decorative zoomorphic bells popular in France at the time, shaped and painted like a dragon or serpent head.[4] Appearing around the same time in military bands was the serpent à pavillon (lit. 'bell serpent') which had a normal brass instrument bell, similar in flare to the later ophicleide.[29] English bass horn[edit] The English bass horn, developed by London-based French musician and inventor Louis Alexandre Frichot in 1799, had an all-metal V-shaped construction, described by German composer Felix Mendelssohn as resembling a watering can. He admired its sound however, and wrote for the instrument in several of his works, including the overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and his fifth \"Reformation\" symphony (1830),[4] although when the Overture was first published, the part was changed to ophicleide for unknown reasons.[30] The bass horn was popular in civic and military bands in Britain and Ireland, and also spread back into orchestras in Europe, where it influenced the inventors of both the ophicleide and later the Baß-Tuba.[31] Early cimbasso[edit] The serpent appears as serpentone in early 19th century Italian operatic scores by composers such as Spontini, Rossini, and Bellini.[32] In Italy it was replaced by the cimbasso, a loose term that referred to several instruments; initially an upright serpent similar to the basson russe, then the ophicleide, early forms of valved tuba (pelittone, bombardone), and finally by the time of Verdi's opera Otello (1887), a valve contrabass trombone.[33] Other upright serpents[edit] In Paris in 1823, Forveille invented his eponymous serpent Forveille, an upright serpent with an enlarged bell section influenced by the (then newly invented) ophicleide. It is distinguished by being made from wood, brass tubing being used only for the leadpipe and first bend.[34] It became popular in bands for its improved intonation and sound quality.[4] In 1828 Jean-Baptiste Coëffet patented his ophimonocleide (\"snake with one key\"), one of the last forms of the upright serpent.[32] It solved a perennial problem of the serpent, its difficult and indistinct B♮ notes. The instrument is built a semitone lower in B♮ and adds a large open tone hole that keeps the instrument in C until its key is pressed, closing the tone hole and producing a clear and resonant B♮. The instrument also has a unique pompe, a double tuning slide that (combined with adjusting the bocal) could change the pitch by up to a major second and allow the player to switch between the different pitch standards of the time (diapason de l'opéra and diapason de la cathédrale).[35] Contemporary revival[edit] The London Serpent Trio, 1989: Andrew van der Beek (left), Christopher Monk (center), Alan Lumsden (right) The era of upright serpents was brief, spanning the first half of the 19th century from their invention to their replacement by the ophicleide and subsequent valved brass instruments.[36] German opera composer Richard Wagner, by the 1869 première of his Der Ring des Nibelungen cycle, was writing his lowest brass parts for tuba and contrabass trombone.[37] Consequently, the serpent had all but disappeared from ensembles by 1900. The serpent has enjoyed a modern revival of interest and manufacture since the mid-20th century. Christopher Monk began building his own replica cornetts and serpents and playing them in historically informed performances. In 1968 he and instrument maker Keith Rogers devised a method of constructing cornetts inexpensively from a composite wood-resin material, which helped to raise interest in these instruments and increase their availability. In 1976 he established the London Serpent Trio with English Early Music Consort players Andrew van der Beek and Alan Lumsden, performing new works and historical arrangements, both serious and whimsical, throughout Europe and North America.[38][39] At the same time in France, historical instrument specialist Bernard Fourtet and jazz musician Michel Godard began promoting use of the serpent, and reintroduced serpent teaching at the Conservatoire de Paris.[40] Among the graduates are Volny Hostiou, who has recorded a significant serpent discography, and Patrick Wibart, also an accomplished ophicleide player.[41][42] Wibart succeeded Godard as the serpent teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris, and also teaches serpent at the Conservatoire de Versailles Grand Parc [fr].[43] The Serpent Newsletter, first published in 1986 as the Newsletter for United Serpents, is published twice a year and edited by Paul Schmidt. It reviews new recordings and publications, covers contemporary performances and events, as well as new discoveries, appearances in media and film, and other developments.[44] Range and performance[edit] Range of the serpent; notes below C₂ are obtained with the embouchure[2] The serpent's range typically covers the two and a half octaves from C2 two octaves below middle C to G4. The range can easily extend downwards to A1 or even F1 by fingering the low C note with all holes covered, and producing falset tones, by slackening the embouchure (\"lipping down\"). Proficient players can play upwards to C5.[45] Monk writes that due to its inherent mechanical and acoustical defects, the serpent is one of the more difficult wind instruments to play well.[46] Although played with an embouchure similar to that used with other brass instruments such", "<6-hop>\n\nLIMIT\".

The musical instrument known as the regal or regalle (from Middle French régale[1]) is a small portable organ, furnished with beating reeds and having two bellows.[2] The instrument enjoyed its greatest popularity during the Renaissance. The name \"regal\" was also sometimes given to the reed stops of a pipe organ, and more especially to the vox humana stop.", "<8-hop>\n\nHistory[edit] The sound of the regal is produced by brass reeds held in resonators.[2] The length of the vibrating portion of the reed determines its pitch and is regulated by means of a wire passing through the socket, the other end pressing on the reed at the proper distance. The resonators in the regal are not intended to reinforce the vibrations of the beating reed or of its overtones (as in the reed pipes of the organ), but merely to form an attachment to keep the reed in place without interfering with its function. A common compass was C/E--c′′′ (four octaves, with a short octave in the bass), though this was by no means standardized. Most regals were placed on a table to be played, and required two people—one to play the instrument, and another to pump the bellows. Bible Regal c. 1800, from St. Cecilias Hall Museum, Edinburgh Michael Praetorius (1618) mentions a larger regal used in the court orchestras of some of the German princes, more like a positive organ, containing reeds at 4′, 8′, and even sometimes 16′ pitch, and having two bellows behind the case. These regals were used not only at banquets but often in place of positive organs in churches. A very small regal, sometimes called a Bible regal because it could be separated into sections and folded up like a book, was also mentioned by the same writer, who stated that these little instruments had an unpleasantly harsh tone due to their tiny resonators, which were not quite an inch long. He states that they were first made in Nuremberg and Augsburg. In England and France, the word \"regal\" was sometimes applied to reed stops on the organ; Mersenne (1636) states that the word was applied at that time to the vox humana stop.[2] According to Praetorius, the reed stops of pipe organs required constant tuning; he emphasized the fact that the pitch of the stop fell in summer and rose in winter. The pitch of the other stops rose in summer and fell in winter. Because of civil wars and the ravages of time, very few antique regals survive. They were often mentioned in wills and inventories, such as the list of Henry VIII's musical instruments made after his death by Sir Philip Wilder (British Library Harley MS 1415, fol. 200 seq.), in which no fewer than thirteen pairs of single and five pairs of double regals are mentioned (although at that period, \"pair\" referred to a single instrument). Claudio Monteverdi scored for the regals in his operas, and the instrument was described and illustrated by Sebastian Virdung in 1511, Martin Agricola in 1528, and Othmar Luscinius in 1536. In England, as late as the reign of George III, there was the appointment of tuner of the regals to the Chapel Royal. Drawings of the reeds of regals and other reed pipes, as well as of the instrument itself, are given by Praetorius (pl. iv., xxxviii.). The regal may be seen as the ancestor of the harmonium, the reed organ, and the various varieties of \"squeezebox\" such as the accordion, the concertina, and the Bandoneón.", "<9-hop>\n\nMedia[edit] Sound of a regal \"Al Milanese\", from the Castell-Arquato Manuscript, and an unknown piece, Performed by Ulrich Metzner Sound of a regal stop Excerpt from \"Variations on Est-ce Mars\" by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, performed by Ashtar Moïra Problems playing these files?
