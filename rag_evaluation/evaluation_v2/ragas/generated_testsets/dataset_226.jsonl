It deemphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a percussionist, often at slower tempos than other popular music. Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that create a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable\" feel.[3] It uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, and dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths. Funk originated in the mid-1960s, with James Brown's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeatâ€”with a heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure (\"The One\"), and the application of swung 16th notes and syncopation on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs.[4] Rock- and psychedelia-influenced musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic fostered more eclectic examples of the genre beginning in the late 1960s.[5] Other musical groups developed Brown's innovations during the 1970s and the 1980s, including Kool and the Gang,[6] Ohio Players, Fatback Band, Jimmy Castor Bunch, Earth, Wind & Fire, B.T.

{"user_input": "Can you eloborate on the contributions of Donld M. Marquis to our understanding of early funk music, particularly concerning Buddy Bolden's performances and the cultural context surrounding them?", "reference_contexts": ["Funk derivatives include avant-funk, an avant-garde strain of funk; boogie, a hybrid of electronic music and funk; funk metal; G-funk, a mix of gangsta rap and psychedelic funk; Timba, a form of funky Cuban dance music; and funk jam. It is also the main influence of Washington go-go, a funk subgenre.[8] Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and electronic dance music. The word funk initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from Latin fumigare (which means \"to smoke\") via Old French fungiere and, in this sense, it was first documented in English in 1620. In 1784, funky meaning \"musty\" was first documented, which, in turn, led to a sense of \"earthy\" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something \"deeply or strongly felt\".[9][10] Even though in white culture, the term funk can have negative connotations of odor or being in a bad mood (in a funk), in African communities, the term funk, while still linked to body odor, had the positive sense that a musician's hard-working, honest effort led to sweat, and from their \"physical exertion\" came an \"exquisite\" and \"superlative\" performance.[11] In early jam sessions, musicians would encourage one another to \"get down\" by telling one another, \"Now, put some stank on it!\" At least as early as 1907, jazz songs carried titles such as Funky. The first example is an unrecorded number by Buddy Bolden, remembered as either \"Funky Butt\" or \"Buddy Bolden's Blues\", with improvised lyrics that were, according to Donald M. Marquis, either \"comical and light\" or \"crude and downright obscene\" but, in one way or another, referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where Bolden's band played.[12][13] As late as the 1950s and early 1960s, when funk and funky were used increasingly in the context of jazz music, the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company. According to one source, New Orleans-born drummer Earl Palmer \"was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable.\"[14] The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving, insistent rhythm, implying a more carnal quality. This early form of the music set the pattern for later musicians.[15] The music was identified as slow, sexy, loose, riff-oriented and danceable.[citation needed] The meaning of funk continues to captivate the genre of black music, feeling, and knowledge. Recent scholarship in black studies has taken the term funk in its many iterations to consider the range of black movement and culture. In particular, L.H. Stallings's Funk the Erotic: Transaesthetics and Black Sexual Cultures explores these multiple meanings of funk as a way to theorize sexuality, culture, and western hegemony within the many locations of funk: \"street parties, drama/theater, strippers and strip clubs, pornography, and self-published fiction.\"[16] Like soul, funk is based on dance music, so it has a strong \"rhythmic role\".[17] The sound of funk is as much based on the \"spaces between the notes\" as the notes that are played; as such, rests between notes are important.[18] While there are rhythmic similarities between funk and disco, funk has a \"central dance beat that's slower, sexier and more syncopated than disco\", and funk rhythm section musicians add more \"subtextures\", complexity and \"personality\" onto the main beat than a programmed synth-based disco ensemble.[19] Before funk, most pop music was based on sequences of eighth notes, because the fast tempos made further subdivisions of the beat infeasible.[3] The innovation of funk was that by using slower tempos (surely influenced by the revival of blues in the early 1960s), funk \"created space for further rhythmic subdivision, so a bar of 4/4 could now accommodate possible 16 note placements.\"[3] Specifically, by having the guitar and drums play in \"motoring\" sixteenth-note rhythms, it created the opportunity for the other instruments to play \"more syncopated, broken-up style\", which facilitated a move to more \"liberated\" basslines. Together, these \"interlocking parts\" created a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable feel\".[3]"], "reference": "According to Donald M.

{"user_input": "Who is Bernard Edwards?", "reference_contexts": ["Funk creates an intense groove by using strong guitar riffs and basslines played on electric bass. Like Motown recordings, funk songs use basslines as the centerpiece of songs. Indeed, funk has been called the style in which the bassline is most prominent in the songs,[26] with the bass playing the \"hook\" of the song.[27] Early funk basslines used syncopation (typically syncopated eighth notes), but with the addition of more of a \"driving feel\" than in New Orleans funk, and they used blues scale notes along with the major third above the root.[28] Later funk basslines use sixteenth note syncopation, blues scales, and repetitive patterns, often with leaps of an octave or a larger interval.[27] Funk basslines emphasize repetitive patterns, locked-in grooves, continuous playing, and slap and popping bass. Slapping and popping uses a mixture of thumb-slapped low notes (also called \"thumped\") and finger \"popped\" (or plucked) high notes, allowing the bass to have a drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk. Notable slap and funky players include Bernard Edwards (Chic), Robert \"Kool\" Bell, Mark Adams (Slave), Johnny Flippin (Fatback)[29] and Bootsy Collins.[30] While slap and funky is important, some influential bassists who play funk, such as Rocco Prestia (from Tower of Power), did not use the approach, and instead used a typical fingerstyle method based on James Jamerson's Motown playing style.[30] Larry Graham from Sly and the Family Stone is an influential bassist.[31] Funk bass has an \"earthy, percussive kind of feel\", in part due to the use of muted, rhythmic ghost notes[31] (also called \"dead notes\").[30] Some funk bass players use electronic effects units to alter the tone of their instrument, such as \"envelope filters\" (an auto-wah effect that creates a \"gooey, slurpy, quacky, and syrupy\" sound)[32] and imitate keyboard synthesizer bass tones[33] (e.g., the Mutron envelope filter)[27] and overdriven fuzz bass effects, which are used to create the \"classic fuzz tone that sounds like old school Funk records\".[34] Other effects that are used include the flanger and bass chorus.[27] Collins also used a Mu-Tron Octave Divider, an octave pedal that, like the Octavia pedal popularized by Hendrix, can double a note an octave above and below to create a \"futuristic and fat low-end sound\".[35] Funk drumming creates a groove by emphasizing the drummer's \"feel and emotion\", which including \"occasional tempo fluctuations\", the use of swing feel in some songs (e.g., \"Cissy Strut\" by The Meters and \"I'll Take You There\" by The Staple Singers, which have a half-swung feel), and less use of fills (as they can lessen the groove).[36] Drum fills are \"few and economical\", to ensure that the drumming stays \"in the pocket\", with a steady tempo and groove.[37] These playing techniques are supplemented by a set-up for the drum kit that often includes muffled bass drums and toms and tightly tuned snare drums.[36] Double bass drumming sounds are often done by funk drummers with a single pedal, an approach which \"accents the second note... [and] deadens the drumhead's resonance\", which gives a short, muffled bass drum sound.[36] James Brown used two drummers such as Clyde Stubblefield and John 'Jabo' Starks in recording and soul shows.[38] By using two drummers, the JB band was able to maintain a \"solid syncopated\" rhythmic sound, which contributed to the band's distinctive \"Funky Drummer\" rhythm.[38] In Tower of Power drummer David Garibaldi's playing, there are many ghost notes and rim shots.[36] A key part of the funk drumming style is using the hi-hat, with opening and closing the hi-hats during playing (to create \"splash\" accent effects) being an important approach.[39] Two-handed sixteenth notes on the hi-hats, sometimes with a degree of swing feel, is used in funk.[36] Jim Payne states that funk drumming uses a \"wide-open\" approach to improvisation around rhythmic ideas from Latin music, ostinatos, that are repeated \"with only slight variations\", an approach which he says causes the \"mesmerizing\" nature of funk.[40] Payne states that funk can be thought of as \"rock played in a more syncopated manner\", particularly with the bass drum, which plays syncopated eighth-note and sixteenth-note patterns that were innovated by drummer Clive Williams (with Joe Tex); George Brown (with Kool & the Gang) and James \"Diamond\" Williams (with The Ohio Players).[41] As with rock, the snare provides backbeats in most funk (albeit with additional soft ghost notes).[40] In funk, guitarists often mix playing chords of a short duration (nicknamed \"stabs\") with faster rhythms and riffs.[17] Guitarists playing rhythmic parts often play sixteenth notes, including with percussive ghost notes.[17] Chord extensions are favored, such as ninth chords.[17] Typically, funk uses \"two interlocking [electric] guitar parts\", with a rhythm guitarist and a \"tenor guitarist\" who plays single notes. The two guitarists trade off their lines to create a \"call-and-response, intertwined pocket.\"[42] If a band only has one guitarist, this effect may be recreated by overdubbing in the studio, or, in a live show, by having a single guitarist play both parts, to the degree that this is possible.[42] In funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, using a style of picking called the \"chank\" or \"chicken scratch\", in which the guitar strings are pressed lightly against the fingerboard and then quickly released just enough to get a muted \"scratching\" sound that is produced by rapid rhythmic strumming of the opposite hand near the bridge.[43] Early examples of that technique used on rhythm and blues are heard on the Johnny Otis song \"Willie and the Hand Jive\" in 1957, with future James Brown band guitar player Jimmy Nolen. The technique can be broken down into three approaches: the \"chika\", the \"chank\" and the \"choke\". With the \"chika\" comes a muted sound of strings being hit against the fingerboard; \"chank\" is a staccato attack done by releasing the chord with the fretting hand after strumming it; and \"choking\" generally uses all the strings being strummed and heavily muted.[18] The result of these factors was a rhythm guitar sound that seemed to float somewhere between the low-end thump of the electric bass and the"], "reference": "Bernard Edwards (Chic) is a notable slap and funky player.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "Maceo Parker, he do what in funk music?", "reference_contexts": ["A great deal of funk is rhythmically based on a two-celled onbeat/offbeat structure, which originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions. New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the Afro-Cuban mambo and conga in the late 1940s, and made it its own.[20] New Orleans funk, as it was called, gained international acclaim largely because James Brown's rhythm section used it to great effect.[21] Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. Some examples of chords used in funk are minor eleventh chords (e.g., F minor 11th); dominant seventh with added sharp ninth and a suspended fourth (e.g., C7 (#9) sus 4); dominant ninth chords (e.g., F9); and minor sixth chords (e.g., C minor 6).[18] The six-ninth chord is used in funk (e.g., F 6/9); it is a major chord with an added sixth and ninth.[18] In funk, minor seventh chords are more common than minor triads because minor triads were found to be too thin-sounding.[22] Some of the best known and most skillful soloists in funk have jazz backgrounds. Trombonist Fred Wesley and saxophonists Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker are among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, having worked with James Brown, George Clinton and Prince. Unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk often uses a static single-chord or two-chord vamp (often alternating a minor seventh chord and a related dominant seventh chord, such as A minor to D7) during all or part of a song, with melodo-harmonic movement and a complex, driving rhythmic feel. Even though some funk songs are mainly one-chord vamps, the rhythm section musicians may embellish this chord by moving it up or down a semitone or a tone to create chromatic passing chords. For example, the verse section of \"Play That Funky Music\" (by Wild Cherry) mainly uses an E ninth chord, but it also uses F#9 and F9.[23] The chords used in funk songs typically imply a Dorian or Mixolydian mode, as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with the blues scale. In the 1970s, jazz music drew upon funk to create a new subgenre of jazz-funk, which can be heard in recordings by Miles Davis (Live-Evil, On the Corner), and Herbie Hancock (Head Hunters). Funk continues the African musical tradition of improvisation, in that in a funk band, the group would typically \"feel\" when to change, by \"jamming\" and \"grooving\", even in the studio recording stage, which might only be based on the skeleton framework for each song.[24] Funk uses \"collective improvisation\", in which musicians at rehearsals would have what was metaphorically a musical \"conversation\", an approach which extended to the onstage performances.[25] cutting tone of the snare and hi-hats, with a rhythmically melodic feel that fell deep in the pocket. Guitarist Jimmy Nolen, longtime guitarist for James Brown, developed this technique. On Brown's \"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\" (1969), however, Jimmy Nolen's guitar part has a bare bones tonal structure. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. The guitar is used the way that an African drum, or idiophone would be used. Nolen created a \"clean, trebly tone\" by using \"hollow-body jazz guitars with single-coil P-90 pickups\" plugged into a Fender Twin Reverb amp with the mid turned down low and the treble turned up high.[44] Funk guitarists playing rhythm guitar generally avoid distortion effects and amp overdrive to get a clean sound, and given the importance of a crisp, high sound, Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters were widely used for their cutting treble tone.[44] The mids are often cut by guitarists to help the guitar sound different from the horn section, keyboards and other instruments.[44] Given the focus on providing a rhythmic groove, and the lack of emphasis on instrumental guitar melodies and guitar solos, sustain is not sought out by funk rhythm guitarists.[44] Funk rhythm guitarists use compressor volume-control effects to enhance the sound of muted notes, which boosts the \"clucking\" sound and adds \"percussive excitement to funk rhythms\" (an approach used by Nile Rodgers).[45] Guitarist Eddie Hazel from Funkadelic is notable for his solo improvisation (particularly for the solo on \"Maggot Brain\") and guitar riffs, the tone of which was shaped by a Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone pedal.[35] Hazel, along with guitarist Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers, was influenced by Jimi Hendrix's improvised, wah-wah infused solos. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Hendrix, when Hendrix was a part of the Isley Brothers backing band and temporarily lived in the Isleys' household. Funk guitarists use the wah-wah sound effect along with muting the notes to create a percussive sound for their guitar riffs. The phaser effect is often used in funk and R&B guitar playing for its filter sweeping sound effect, an example being the Isley Brothers' song \"Who's That Lady\".[46] Michael Hampton, another P-Funk guitarist, was able to play Hazel's virtuosic solo on \"Maggot Brain\", using a solo approach that added in string bends and Hendrix-style feedback.[35]"], "reference": "Saxophonist Maceo Parker is among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, having worked with James Brown, George Clinton and Prince.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

Valnes acknowledges that funk is male-dominated, but provides insight to the societal circumstances that led to this situation.[117][clarification needed] MonÃ¡e's influences include her mentor Prince, Funkadelic, Lauryn Hill, and other funk and R&B artists, but according to Emily Lordi, \"[Betty] Davis is seldom listed among Janelle MonÃ¡e's many influences, and certainly the younger singer's high-tech concepts, virtuosic performances, and meticulously produced songs are far removed from Davis's proto-punk aesthetic.

There has been much interaction between Indian music and jazz music. An active jazz scene exists today in cities like Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), Pune, Delhi, Goa, and Kolkata. In India, jazz was probably first performed regularly in the metropoles Calcutta and Bombay in the early or middle 1920s.[2][3] The era from the 1930s to the 1950s is often called as the golden age of jazz in India. It began with jazz musicians like Leon Abbey, Crickett Smith, Creighton Thompson, Ken Mac, Roy Butler, Teddy Weatherford (who recorded with Louis Armstrong), and Rudy Jackson who toured India to avoid the racial discrimination they faced in the United States.[4] In the winter of 1935, Leon Abbey, a violinist from Minnesota brought the first 8-piece band to Bombay.[5] In the 1930s, Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle against the British had reached a crucial stage. Bombay was a rising metropolis. There was also a great sense of political freedom, which was being transmitted into the arts. The ballrooms of five-star hotels and in the nightclubs of major Indian cities were jazz centres. As nationalism swept the country, these venues became the refuge of the European and Indian elite, the aristocrats, the moneyed and the public servants. During this period, musicians such as Chic Chocolate, Frank Fernand, Micky Correa,[6] Rudy Cotton, Hal and Henry Green, Josic Menzie, Pamela McCarthy, and Chris Perry were at the forefront of the burgeoning jazz scene in Bombay, the nerve center of which was at the Taj Mahal hotel ballroom, which became the node of essential transmission of cultural messages between East and West. These musicians often played at five-star hotels, but they were regulars at the second level, at the Ambassador Starlight Roof Gardens, the Bristol Grill, the Dadar Catholic Institute, the Greens Hotel, the Ritz Roof Garden, the West End Hotel Roof Garden and the YMCA. Many of these musicians were Goans, because Goans learnt western music under Portuguese rule. Most of the Goan jazz musicians also worked in the Bollywood film industry and were responsible for the introduction of genres like jazz and swing to Hindi film music. Although jazz in India began as an entertainment for the elite, it made its way to the working class and into Hindi films. Frank Fernand and Anthony Gonsalves not only infused the sound of western music into Bollywood, but were also filled with India's new-found nationalism and developed an authentic foundation to link the world of jazz with that of Indian classical music.[7] The jazz fraternity was also a melting pot of people of different communities because there were Goans, Anglo-Indians and people from other communities like Rudy Cotton who was a Parsi. Jazz and Indian classical music share some similarities, one of them being that they both involve improvisation. Musicians realised this and collaborations between Indian classical musicians and Western jazz musicians which had commenced in the 1940s led to the development of a new genre of music called Indo jazz consisting of jazz, classical and Indian influences. Ravi Shankar, John Coltrane, John Mayer and John McLaughlin were some of the pioneers of the fusion of jazz and Indian music.[8][9] Conversely, Indian classical music has also had a significant impact on a subgenre of jazz music known as free jazz.[10][11]"], "reference": "Funk, originating in African-American communities, is a music genre that emphasizes rhythm and groove.

{"user_input": "How did acid house influence the development of breakbeat music, and what are some examples of subgenres that emerged from this combination?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nBreakbeat is a broad type of electronic music that uses drum breaks, often sampled from early recordings of funk, jazz, and R&B. Breakbeats have been used in styles such as Florida breaks, hip hop, jungle, drum and bass, big beat, breakbeat hardcore, and UK garage styles (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep).[1][2] The origin of the word \"breakbeat\" is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a \"break\" in the music - for example the Amen break (a drum solo from \"Amen, Brother\" by The Winstons) or the Think Break (from \"Think (About It)\" by Lyn Collins).[1][2] Beginning in 1973 and continuing through the late 1970s and early 1980s, hip hop turntablists such as DJ Kool Herc began using several funk breaks in a row, using drum breaks from jazz-funk tracks such as James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" and The Winstons' \"Amen, Brother\", to form the rhythmic base for hip hop songs. DJ Kool Herc's breaks style involved playing the same record on two turntables and playing the break repeatedly, alternating between the two records. Grandmaster Flash perfected this idea with what he called the \"quick-mix theory\": he would mark the points on the record where the break began and ended with a crayon, so that he could easily replay the break by spinning the record and not touching the tone arm.[3] This style was copied and improved upon by early hip hop DJs Afrika Bambaataa and Grand Wizard Theodore.[4][dubious â€“ discuss] This style was extremely popular in clubs and dancehalls because the extended breaks compositions provided breakers with more opportunities to showcase their skills. In the late 1970s, breakbeats had attained a large presence in hip hop. In the 1980s, the evolution of technology began to make sampling breaks easier and more affordable for DJs and producers, which helped nurture the commercialization of hip hop. Through early techniques such as pausing tapes and then recording the break, by the 1980s, technology allowed anybody with a tape recorder to find the breakbeat.[5] In the late-1980s, breakbeat became an essential feature of many genres of breaks music which became popular within the global dance music scene, including acid breaks, electro-funk, and Miami bass, and a decade later big beat and nu skool breaks. In the early 1990s, acid house artists and producers started using breakbeat samples in their music to create breakbeat hardcore.[6] The hardcore scene then diverged into subgenres like jungle and drum and bass, which generally was faster and focused more on complex sampled drum patterns. An example of this is Goldie's album Timeless. Josh Lawford of Ravescene prophesied that breakbeat was \"the death-knell of rave\"[7] because the ever-changing drumbeat patterns of breakbeat music didn't allow for the same zoned out, trance-like state that the standard, steady 4/4 beats of house enabled. Incorporating many components of those genres, the Florida breaks subgenre followed during the early-to-mid 1990s and had a unique sound that was soon internationally popular among producers, DJs, and club-goers. In 1994, the influential techno act Autechre released the Anti EP in response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, deliberately using advanced algorithmic programming to generate non-repetitive breakbeats for the full duration of the tracks, in order to subvert the legal definitions within that legislation which specified in the section creating police powers to remove ravers from raves that \"'music' includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\". In the late 1990s, another style of breakbeat emerged, funky breaks, a style that was incorporating elements of trance, hip hop and jungle. It was pioneered by the Chemical Brothers and James Lavelle's Mo'Wax Records imprint. The genre had commercial peak in 1997, when such music was topping in pop charts and often featured in commercials. The most notable artists of the sound were The Prodigy, Death in Vegas, The Crystal Method, and Propellerheads.[8] The tempo of breaks tracks, ranging from 110 to 150 beats per minute, allows DJs to mix breaks with a wide range of different genres in their sets. This has led to breakbeats being used in many hip hop, jungle/drum & bass and hardcore tracks. They can also be heard in other music, anywhere from popular music to background music in car and clothing commercials on radio or TV.[9] The Amen break, a drum break from The Winstons' song \"Amen, Brother\" is widely regarded as one of the most widely used and sampled breaks among music using breakbeats.[10] This break was first used on \"King of the Beats\" by Mantronix, and has since been used in thousands of songs.[11] Other popular breaks are from James Brown's Funky Drummer (1970) and Give it Up or Turnit a Loose, The Incredible Bongo Band's 1973 cover of The Shadows' \"Apache\", and Lyn Collins' 1972 song \"Think (About It)\".[4] The Winstons have not received royalties for third-party use of samples of the break recorded on their original music release.[11] With the advent of digital sampling and music editing on the computer, breakbeats have become much easier to create and use. Now, instead of cutting and splicing tape sections or constantly backspinning two records at the same time, a computer program can be used to cut, paste, and loop breakbeats endlessly. Digital effects such as filters, reverb, reversing, time stretching and pitch shifting can be added to the beat, and even to individual sounds by themselves. Individual instruments from within a breakbeat can be sampled and combined with others, thereby creating wholly new breakbeat patterns. With the rise in popularity of breakbeat music and the advent of digital audio samplers, companies started selling \"breakbeat packages\" for the express purpose of helping artists create breakbeats. A breakbeat kit CD would contain many breakbeat samples from different songs and artists, often without the artist's permission or even knowledge.[12] \"", "<2-hop>\n\nAcid breaks\" or \"chemical breaks\" is acid house, but with a breakbeat instead of a house beat. One of the earliest synthesizers to be employed in acid music was the Roland TB-303, which makes use of a resonant low-pass filter to emphasize the harmonics of the sound. The Asian breakbeat scene is a remix genre blending elements of Freestyle, electro, progressive trance melodies, Florida Breaks drums and Southern rap, Crunk. It was originated and made popular by predominantly Vietnamese American and Southeast Asian DJs throughout the U.S. South (Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina) during the 1990s and 2000s.[13][14] Notable active DJs include New Orleans' Dj Babyboi, Tinman, and Loopy.[15] Big beat is a term employed since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe much of the music by artists such as The Prodigy, Cut La Roc, Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method and Propellerheads typically driven by heavy breakbeats combined with four-on-the floor kick drums, synthesizer-generated loops and patterns in common with established forms of electronic dance music such as techno and acid house. Breakbeat combined with electro music, often using 80s synths, robotic sounds, vocals with vocoders or talkboxes, and infused with elements of funk. Electro breaks was pioneered by Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force, Kraftwerk, Man Parrish, Cybotron, and Newcleus. In Spain from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, breakbeat became a massive social movement, especially in the southern part of the country, Andalusia. Largely responsible for the spread of the \"broken rhythm\" in Andalusia, was the public radio station of the autonomous community: Canal Sur Radio and Canal Fiesta, known at that time as FÃ³rmula 1, where the program \"Mundo Evassion\" was broadcast, or \"Evassion Planet\" which was presented by Dani Moreno. Artists of that era included Digital Base, Dj Nitro, Jordi Slate, Man, Wally, Kultur, Jan B, Anuschka, and Ale Baquero. [16] The breakbeat of Andalusia has formed its own style, based on a simple structure of pre breaks + pre drop + drop. All this is repeated a second time with some variations in the song. With this structure, the tracks are mixed when one has passed the drop, until the pre drop of the next one arrives, respecting the melodies without breaks. Andalusian breakbeat has once again become a mass industry, with festivals almost exclusively dedicated to this genre, such as the Winter Festival, Summer Festival, Floridance, Retro Fest, and Olibass. [17] Progressive breaks or prog breaks, also known as atmospheric breaks, is a subgenre of breaks that is essentially a fusion of breakbeat and progressive house. Much like progressive house, this subgenre is characterized by its \"trancey\" sound. Its defining traits include extended synthesizer pads and washes, melodic synth leads, heavy reverberation, and electronic breakbeats. However, unlike progressive house, very few progressive breaks tracks have vocals, with most tracks being entirely instrumental or using only electronically altered snippets of vocal samples for sonic effect. Typical progressive breaks tracks will often have a long build-up section that leads to a breakdown and a climax, often having numerous sonic elements being added or subtracted from the track at various intervals in order to increase its intensity. Progressive breaks artists include Hybrid, BT, Way Out West, Digital Witchcraft, Momu, Wrecked Angle, Fourthstate, Burufunk, Under This and Fretwell."], "reference": "In the early 1990s, acid house artists and producers started using breakbeat samples in their music to create breakbeat hardcore.

It is also the main influence of Washington go-go, a funk subgenre.[8] Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and electronic dance music. The word funk initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from Latin fumigare (which means \"to smoke\") via Old French fungiere and, in this sense, it was first documented in English in 1620. In 1784, funky meaning \"musty\" was first documented, which, in turn, led to a sense of \"earthy\" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something \"deeply or strongly felt\".[9][10] Even though in white culture, the term funk can have negative connotations of odor or being in a bad mood (in a funk), in African communities, the term funk, while still linked to body odor, had the positive sense that a musician's hard-working, honest effort led to sweat, and from their \"physical exertion\" came an \"exquisite\" and \"superlative\" performance.[11] In early jam sessions, musicians would encourage one another to \"get down\" by telling one another, \"Now, put some stank on it!\" At least as early as 1907, jazz songs carried titles such as Funky. The first example is an unrecorded number by Buddy Bolden, remembered as either \"Funky Butt\" or \"Buddy Bolden's Blues\", with improvised lyrics that were, according to Donald M. Marquis, either \"comical and light\" or \"crude and downright obscene\" but, in one way or another, referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where Bolden's band played.[12][13] As late as the 1950s and early 1960s, when funk and funky were used increasingly in the context of jazz music, the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company. According to one source, New Orleans-born drummer Earl Palmer \"was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable.\"[14] The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving, insistent rhythm, implying a more carnal quality. This early form of the music set the pattern for later musicians.[15] The music was identified as slow, sexy, loose, riff-oriented and danceable.[citation needed] The meaning of funk continues to captivate the genre of black music, feeling, and knowledge. Recent scholarship in black studies has taken the term funk in its many iterations to consider the range of black movement and culture. In particular, L.H. Stallings's Funk the Erotic: Transaesthetics and Black Sexual Cultures explores these multiple meanings of funk as a way to theorize sexuality, culture, and western hegemony within the many locations of funk: \"street parties, drama/theater, strippers and strip clubs, pornography, and self-published fiction.\"[16] Like soul, funk is based on dance music, so it has a strong \"rhythmic role\".[17] The sound of funk is as much based on the \"spaces between the notes\" as the notes that are played; as such, rests between notes are important.[18] While there are rhythmic similarities between funk and disco, funk has a \"central dance beat that's slower, sexier and more syncopated than disco\", and funk rhythm section musicians add more \"subtextures\", complexity and \"personality\" onto the main beat than a programmed synth-based disco ensemble.[19] Before funk, most pop music was based on sequences of eighth notes, because the fast tempos made further subdivisions of the beat infeasible.[3] The innovation of funk was that by using slower tempos (surely influenced by the revival of blues in the early 1960s), funk \"created space for further rhythmic subdivision, so a bar of 4/4 could now accommodate possible 16 note placements.\"[3] Specifically, by having the guitar and drums play in \"motoring\" sixteenth-note rhythms, it created the opportunity for the other instruments to play \"more syncopated, broken-up style\", which facilitated a move to more \"liberated\" basslines. Together, these \"interlocking parts\" created a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable feel\".[3]", "<3-hop>\n\nIn the 21st century,[when?] artists like Janelle MonÃ¡e have opened the doors for more scholarship and analysis on the female impact on the funk music genre.[dubious â€“ discuss] MonÃ¡e's style bends concepts of gender, sexuality, and self-expression in a manner similar to the way some male pioneers in funk broke boundaries.[117] Her albums center on Afro-futuristic concepts, centering on elements of female and black empowerment and visions of a dystopian future.[118] In his article \"Janelle MonÃ¡e and Afro-sonic Feminist Funk\", Matthew Valnes writes that Monae's involvement in the funk genre is juxtaposed with the traditional view of funk as a male-centered genre.

Breakbeats have been used in styles such as Florida breaks, hip hop, jungle, drum and bass, big beat, breakbeat hardcore, and UK garage styles (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep).[1][2] The origin of the word \"breakbeat\" is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a \"break\" in the music - for example the Amen break (a drum solo from \"Amen, Brother\" by The Winstons) or the Think Break (from \"Think (About It)\" by Lyn Collins).[1][2] Beginning in 1973 and continuing through the late 1970s and early 1980s, hip hop turntablists such as DJ Kool Herc began using several funk breaks in a row, using drum breaks from jazz-funk tracks such as James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" and The Winstons' \"Amen, Brother\", to form the rhythmic base for hip hop songs. DJ Kool Herc's breaks style involved playing the same record on two turntables and playing the break repeatedly, alternating between the two records. Grandmaster Flash perfected this idea with what he called the \"quick-mix theory\": he would mark the points on the record where the break began and ended with a crayon, so that he could easily replay the break by spinning the record and not touching the tone arm.[3] This style was copied and improved upon by early hip hop DJs Afrika Bambaataa and Grand Wizard Theodore.[4][dubious â€“ discuss] This style was extremely popular in clubs and dancehalls because the extended breaks compositions provided breakers with more opportunities to showcase their skills. In the late 1970s, breakbeats had attained a large presence in hip hop. In the 1980s, the evolution of technology began to make sampling breaks easier and more affordable for DJs and producers, which helped nurture the commercialization of hip hop. Through early techniques such as pausing tapes and then recording the break, by the 1980s, technology allowed anybody with a tape recorder to find the breakbeat.[5] In the late-1980s, breakbeat became an essential feature of many genres of breaks music which became popular within the global dance music scene, including acid breaks, electro-funk, and Miami bass, and a decade later big beat and nu skool breaks. In the early 1990s, acid house artists and producers started using breakbeat samples in their music to create breakbeat hardcore.[6] The hardcore scene then diverged into subgenres like jungle and drum and bass, which generally was faster and focused more on complex sampled drum patterns. An example of this is Goldie's album Timeless. Josh Lawford of Ravescene prophesied that breakbeat was \"the death-knell of rave\"[7] because the ever-changing drumbeat patterns of breakbeat music didn't allow for the same zoned out, trance-like state that the standard, steady 4/4 beats of house enabled. Incorporating many components of those genres, the Florida breaks subgenre followed during the early-to-mid 1990s and had a unique sound that was soon internationally popular among producers, DJs, and club-goers. In 1994, the influential techno act Autechre released the Anti EP in response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, deliberately using advanced algorithmic programming to generate non-repetitive breakbeats for the full duration of the tracks, in order to subvert the legal definitions within that legislation which specified in the section creating police powers to remove ravers from raves that \"'music' includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\". In the late 1990s, another style of breakbeat emerged, funky breaks, a style that was incorporating elements of trance, hip hop and jungle. It was pioneered by the Chemical Brothers and James Lavelle's Mo'Wax Records imprint. The genre had commercial peak in 1997, when such music was topping in pop charts and often featured in commercials. The most notable artists of the sound were The Prodigy, Death in Vegas, The Crystal Method, and Propellerheads.[8] The tempo of breaks tracks, ranging from 110 to 150 beats per minute, allows DJs to mix breaks with a wide range of different genres in their sets. This has led to breakbeats being used in many hip hop, jungle/drum & bass and hardcore tracks. They can also be heard in other music, anywhere from popular music to background music in car and clothing commercials on radio or TV.[9] The Amen break, a drum break from The Winstons' song \"Amen, Brother\" is widely regarded as one of the most widely used and sampled breaks among music using breakbeats.[10] This break was first used on \"King of the Beats\" by Mantronix, and has since been used in thousands of songs.[11] Other popular breaks are from James Brown's Funky Drummer (1970) and Give it Up or Turnit a Loose, The Incredible Bongo Band's 1973 cover of The Shadows' \"Apache\", and Lyn Collins' 1972 song \"Think (About It)\".[4] The Winstons have not received royalties for third-party use of samples of the break recorded on their original music release.[11] With the advent of digital sampling and music editing on the computer, breakbeats have become much easier to create and use. Now, instead of cutting and splicing tape sections or constantly backspinning two records at the same time, a computer program can be used to cut, paste, and loop breakbeats endlessly. Digital effects such as filters, reverb, reversing, time stretching and pitch shifting can be added to the beat, and even to individual sounds by themselves. Individual instruments from within a breakbeat can be sampled and combined with others, thereby creating wholly new breakbeat patterns. With the rise in popularity of breakbeat music and the advent of digital audio samplers, companies started selling \"breakbeat packages\" for the express purpose of helping artists create breakbeats. A breakbeat kit CD would contain many breakbeat samples from different songs and artists, often without the artist's permission or even knowledge.[12] \""], "reference": "Beginning in 1973, hip hop turntablists like DJ Kool Herc used funk breaks from jazz-funk tracks such as James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" and The Winstons' \"Amen, Brother\" to form the rhythmic base for hip hop songs.

Like Motown recordings, funk songs use basslines as the centerpiece of songs. Indeed, funk has been called the style in which the bassline is most prominent in the songs,[26] with the bass playing the \"hook\" of the song.[27] Early funk basslines used syncopation (typically syncopated eighth notes), but with the addition of more of a \"driving feel\" than in New Orleans funk, and they used blues scale notes along with the major third above the root.[28] Later funk basslines use sixteenth note syncopation, blues scales, and repetitive patterns, often with leaps of an octave or a larger interval.[27] Funk basslines emphasize repetitive patterns, locked-in grooves, continuous playing, and slap and popping bass. Slapping and popping uses a mixture of thumb-slapped low notes (also called \"thumped\") and finger \"popped\" (or plucked) high notes, allowing the bass to have a drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk. Notable slap and funky players include Bernard Edwards (Chic), Robert \"Kool\" Bell, Mark Adams (Slave), Johnny Flippin (Fatback)[29] and Bootsy Collins.[30] While slap and funky is important, some influential bassists who play funk, such as Rocco Prestia (from Tower of Power), did not use the approach, and instead used a typical fingerstyle method based on James Jamerson's Motown playing style.[30] Larry Graham from Sly and the Family Stone is an influential bassist.[31] Funk bass has an \"earthy, percussive kind of feel\", in part due to the use of muted, rhythmic ghost notes[31] (also called \"dead notes\").[30] Some funk bass players use electronic effects units to alter the tone of their instrument, such as \"envelope filters\" (an auto-wah effect that creates a \"gooey, slurpy, quacky, and syrupy\" sound)[32] and imitate keyboard synthesizer bass tones[33] (e.g., the Mutron envelope filter)[27] and overdriven fuzz bass effects, which are used to create the \"classic fuzz tone that sounds like old school Funk records\".[34] Other effects that are used include the flanger and bass chorus.[27] Collins also used a Mu-Tron Octave Divider, an octave pedal that, like the Octavia pedal popularized by Hendrix, can double a note an octave above and below to create a \"futuristic and fat low-end sound\".[35] Funk drumming creates a groove by emphasizing the drummer's \"feel and emotion\", which including \"occasional tempo fluctuations\", the use of swing feel in some songs (e.g., \"Cissy Strut\" by The Meters and \"I'll Take You There\" by The Staple Singers, which have a half-swung feel), and less use of fills (as they can lessen the groove).[36] Drum fills are \"few and economical\", to ensure that the drumming stays \"in the pocket\", with a steady tempo and groove.[37] These playing techniques are supplemented by a set-up for the drum kit that often includes muffled bass drums and toms and tightly tuned snare drums.[36] Double bass drumming sounds are often done by funk drummers with a single pedal, an approach which \"accents the second note... [and] deadens the drumhead's resonance\", which gives a short, muffled bass drum sound.[36] James Brown used two drummers such as Clyde Stubblefield and John 'Jabo' Starks in recording and soul shows.[38] By using two drummers, the JB band was able to maintain a \"solid syncopated\" rhythmic sound, which contributed to the band's distinctive \"Funky Drummer\" rhythm.[38] In Tower of Power drummer David Garibaldi's playing, there are many ghost notes and rim shots.[36] A key part of the funk drumming style is using the hi-hat, with opening and closing the hi-hats during playing (to create \"splash\" accent effects) being an important approach.[39] Two-handed sixteenth notes on the hi-hats, sometimes with a degree of swing feel, is used in funk.[36] Jim Payne states that funk drumming uses a \"wide-open\" approach to improvisation around rhythmic ideas from Latin music, ostinatos, that are repeated \"with only slight variations\", an approach which he says causes the \"mesmerizing\" nature of funk.[40] Payne states that funk can be thought of as \"rock played in a more syncopated manner\", particularly with the bass drum, which plays syncopated eighth-note and sixteenth-note patterns that were innovated by drummer Clive Williams (with Joe Tex); George Brown (with Kool & the Gang) and James \"Diamond\" Williams (with The Ohio Players).[41] As with rock, the snare provides backbeats in most funk (albeit with additional soft ghost notes).[40] In funk, guitarists often mix playing chords of a short duration (nicknamed \"stabs\") with faster rhythms and riffs.[17] Guitarists playing rhythmic parts often play sixteenth notes, including with percussive ghost notes.[17] Chord extensions are favored, such as ninth chords.[17] Typically, funk uses \"two interlocking [electric] guitar parts\", with a rhythm guitarist and a \"tenor guitarist\" who plays single notes. The two guitarists trade off their lines to create a \"call-and-response, intertwined pocket.\"[42] If a band only has one guitarist, this effect may be recreated by overdubbing in the studio, or, in a live show, by having a single guitarist play both parts, to the degree that this is possible.[42] In funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, using a style of picking called the \"chank\" or \"chicken scratch\", in which the guitar strings are pressed lightly against the fingerboard and then quickly released just enough to get a muted \"scratching\" sound that is produced by rapid rhythmic strumming of the opposite hand near the bridge.[43] Early examples of that technique used on rhythm and blues are heard on the Johnny Otis song \"Willie and the Hand Jive\" in 1957, with future James Brown band guitar player Jimmy Nolen. The technique can be broken down into three approaches: the \"chika\", the \"chank\" and the \"choke\". With the \"chika\" comes a muted sound of strings being hit against the fingerboard; \"chank\" is a staccato attack done by releasing the chord with the fretting hand after strumming it; and \"choking\" generally uses all the strings being strummed and heavily muted.[18] The result of these factors was a rhythm guitar sound that seemed to float somewhere between the low-end thump of the electric bass and the", "<2-hop>\n\nNeo soul, which adopted hip hop influences, emerged around 1994. Other subgenres of soul include the \"Motown sound\", a more rhythmic and pop-friendly style that originated from the eponymous label; Southern soul, a driving, energetic variety combining R&B with southern gospel music influences;[12] Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which emerged from the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; and Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral variety with doohickey-wop-inspired vocals. Soul music is a genre that evolved from African American popular music in the United States during the 1950s to the 1970s. It is deeply rooted in gospel and blues, characterized by intense vocal delivery, call-and-response patterns, and melisma. Soul music reinterpreted the sounds of earlier rhythm-and-blues pioneers like Chuck Berry and Ray Charles, and it was a return to African American musical roots after the emergence of rock and roll, which was seen as a white interpretation of rhythm and blues. The style of soul music is marked by its emotional intensity and personal expression. It incorporates elements from gospel music, such as the use of church-rooted call-and-response and vocal techniques. Soul music also draws from blues, evident in its expressive and often improvisational vocal style. The genre was popularized by artists like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Otis Redding, who infused their music with themes of personal and social significance. Soul music also influenced and was influenced by other musical styles. The Motown sound, which is considered a form of soul music, had a lighter, more pop-oriented style, while Southern soul was rawer and more emotive. As the genre evolved, it contributed to the development of funk, disco, and hip-hop, with its emphasis on rhythm and groove becoming foundational to these later styles. Soul music has its roots in traditional African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles â€“ in both lyrical content and instrumentation â€“ that began in the 1950s. The term \"soul\" had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States.[13] According to musicologist Barry Hansen,[14] Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of rock and roll sung gospel-style. According to AllMusic, \"Soul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the '60s.\"[16] The phrase \"soul music\" itself, referring to gospel-style music with secular lyrics, was first attested in 1961.[17] The term \"soul\" in African-American parlance has connotations of African-American pride and culture. Gospel groups in the 1940s and '50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The jazz style that originated from gospel became known as soul jazz. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for African-American popular music at the time.[18][19] According to the Acoustic Music Organization, the \"first clear evidence of soul music shows up with the \"5\" Royales, an ex-gospel group that turned to R&B and in Faye Adams, whose \"Shake A Hand\" becomes an R&B standard\".[20] Important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included Clyde McPhatter, Hank Ballard, and Etta James.[14] Ray Charles is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954's \"I Got a Woman\".[21] Singer Bobby Womack said, \"Ray was the genius. He turned the world onto soul music.\"[11] Charles was open in acknowledging the influence of Pilgrim Travelers vocalist Jesse Whitaker on his singing style. Little Richard, who inspired Otis Redding,[22] and James Brown both were equally influential. Brown was nicknamed the \"Godfather of Soul Music\",[15] and Richard proclaimed himself as the \"King of Rockin' and Rollin', Rhythm and Blues Soulin'\", because his music embodied elements of all three, and since he inspired artists in all three genres.[23] Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers.[11][24] Cooke became popular as the lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, before controversially moving into secular music. His recording of \"You Send Me\" in 1957 launched a successful pop music career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of \"Bring It On Home To Me\" has been described as \"perhaps the first record to define the soul experience\".[25] Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved crossover success, especially with his 1957 hit \"Reet Petite\".[26] He even was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances.[27] Husband-wife duo Ike & Tina Turner emerged as \"leading exponents\" of soul music in the 1960s.[28][29] Their debut single \"A Fool in Love\" crossed over to the pop charts in 1960. They earned a Grammy nomination for their song \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" in 1962.[30] Along with the Kings of Rhythm and the Ikettes, they toured the Chitlinâ€™ Circuit as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.[31] Writer Peter Guralnick is among those to identify Solomon Burke as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and Atlantic Records as the key record label. Burke's early 1960s songs, including \"Cry to Me\", \"Just Out of Reach\" and \"Down in the Valley\" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's \"Just Out of Reach\". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke â€” primarily in a pop vein. Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement.[32] Ben E.

If there were two horn players, it could be trumpet and sax, trumpet and trombone, or two saxes.[3] A standard horn trio would consist of trumpet, sax, and trombone, but trios of one trumpet with two saxes, or two trumpets with one sax, were also fairly common.[3] A quartet would be set up the same as a standard horn trio, but with an extra trumpet, sax, or (less frequently) trombone player. Quintets would either be a trio of saxes (typically alto/tenor/baritone, or tenor/tenor/baritone) with a trumpet and a trombone, or a pair each of trumpets and saxes with one trombone. With six instruments, the horn section would usually be two trumpets, three saxes, and a trombone.[3] Notable songs with funk horn sections include: In bands or shows where hiring a horn section is not feasible, a keyboardist can play the horn parts on a synthesizer with brass patches; however, choosing an authentic-sounding synthesizer and brass patch is important.[3] In the 2010s, with micro-MIDI synths, it may even have been possible to have another instrumentalist play the keyboard brass parts, thus enabling the keyboardist to continue to comp throughout the song.[3] Funk bands in the 1970s adopted Afro-American fashion and style, including \"Bell-bottom pants, platform shoes, hoop earring[s], Afros [hairstyles], leather vests,... beaded necklaces\",[65] dashiki shirts, jumpsuits and boots.[66] In contrast to earlier bands such as The Temptations, which wore \"matching suits\" and \"neat haircuts\" to appeal to white mainstream audiences, funk bands adopted an \"African spirit\" in their outfits and style.[60] George Clinton and Parliament are known for their imaginative costumes and \"freedom of dress\", which included bedsheets acting as robes and capes.[67] Funk was formed through a mixture of various music genres that were popular among African Americans in the mid-20th century. Musicologist Anne Danielsen wrote that funk might be placed in the lineage of rhythm and blues, jazz, and soul.[68] Sociologist Darby E. Southgate wrote that funk is \"an amalgam of gospel, soul, jazz fusion, rhythm and blues, and black rock.\"[1] The distinctive characteristics of African-American musical expression are rooted in sub-Saharan African music traditions, and find their earliest expression in spirituals, work chants/songs, praise shouts, gospel, blues, and \"body rhythms\" (hambone, patting juba, and ring shout clapping and stomping patterns).", "<2-hop>\n\nA range of keyboard instruments are used in funk. Acoustic piano is used in funk, including in \"September\" by Earth Wind & Fire and \"Will It Go Round in Circles\" by Billy Preston. The electric piano is used on songs such as Herbie Hancock's \"Chameleon\" (a Fender Rhodes) and \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\" by Joe Zawinul (a Wurlitzer). The clavinet is used for its percussive tone, and it can be heard in songs such as Stevie Wonder's \"Superstition\" and \"Higher Ground\" and Bill Withers' \"Use Me\". The Hammond B-3 organ is used in funk, in songs such as \"Cissy Strut\" by The Meters and \"Love the One You're With\" (with Aretha Franklin singing and Billy Preston on keyboards). Bernie Worrell's range of keyboards from his recordings with Parliament Funkadelic demonstrate the wide range of keyboards used in funk, as they include the Hammond organ (\"Funky Woman\", \"Hit It and Quit It\", \"Wars of Armageddon\"); RMI electric piano (\"I Wanna Know If It's Good to You?\", \"Free Your Mind\", \"Loose Booty\"); acoustic piano (\"Funky Dollar Bill\", \"Jimmy's Got a Little Bit of Bitch in Him\"); clavinet (\"Joyful Process\", \"Up for the Down Stroke\", \"Red Hot Mama\"); Minimoog synthesizer (\"Atmosphere\", \"Flash Light\", \"Aqua Boogie\", \"Knee Deep\", \"Let's Take It to the Stage\"); and ARP string ensemble synth (\"Chocolate City\", \"Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\", \"Undisco Kidd\"). Synthesizers were used in funk both to add to the deep sound of the electric bass, or even to replace the electric bass altogether in some songs.[47] Funk synthesizer bass, most often a Minimoog, was used because it could create layered sounds and new electronic tones that were not feasible on electric bass.[47] In the 1970s, funk used many of the same vocal styles that were used in African-American music in the 1960s, including singing influences from blues, gospel, jazz and doo-wop.[38] Like these other African-American styles, funk used \"[y]ells, shouts, hollers, moans, humming, and melodic riffs\", along with styles such as call and response and narration of stories (like the African oral tradition approach).[48] The call and response in funk can be between the lead singer and the band members who act as backup vocalists.[49] As funk emerged from soul, the vocals in funk share soul's approach; however, funk vocals tend to be \"more punctuated, energetic, rhythmically percussive[,] and less embellished\" with ornaments, and the vocal lines tend to resemble horn parts and have \"pushed\" rhythms.[50] Funk bands such as Earth, Wind & Fire have harmony vocal parts.[19] Songs like \"Super Bad\" by James Brown included \"double-voice\" along with \"yells, shouts and screams\".[51] Funk singers used a \"black aesthetic\" to perform that made use of \"colorful and lively exchange of gestures, facial expressions, body posture, and vocal phrases\" to create an engaging performance.[52] The lyrics in funk music addressed issues faced by the African American community in the United States during the 1970s, which arose due to the move away from an industrial, working-class economy to an information economy, which harmed the Black working class.[53] Funk songs by The Ohio Players, Earth, Wind & Fire, and James Brown raised issues faced by lower-income Blacks in their song lyrics, such as poor \"economic conditions and themes of poor inner-city life in the black communities\".[54] The Funkadelic song \"One Nation Under A Groove\" (1978) is about the challenges that Blacks overcame during the 1960s civil rights movement, and it includes an exhortation for Blacks in the 1970s to capitalize on the new \"social and political opportunities\" that had become available in the 1970s.[55] The Isley Brothers song \"Fight the Power\" (1975) has a political message.[56] Parliament's song \"Chocolate City\" (1975) metaphorically refers to Washington, D.C., and other US cities that have a mainly Black population, and it draws attention to the potential power that Black voters wield and suggests that a Black President be considered in the future.[57] The political themes of funk songs and the aiming of the messages to a Black audience echoed the new image of Blacks that was created in Blaxploitation films, which depicted \"African-American men and women standing their ground and fighting for what was right\".[58] Both funk and Blaxploitation films addressed issues faced by Blacks and told stories from a Black perspective.[58] Another link between 1970s funk and Blaxploitation films is that many of these films used funk soundtracks (e.g., Curtis Mayfield for Superfly; James Brown and Fred Wesley for Black Caesar and War for Youngblood).[59] Funk songs included metaphorical language that was understood best by listeners who were \"familiar with the black aesthetic and [black] vernacular\".[60] For example, funk songs included expressions such as \"shake your money maker\", \"funk yourself right out\" and \"move your boogie body\".[61] Another example is the use of \"bad\" in the song \"Super Bad\" (1970), which black listeners knew meant \"good\" or \"great\".[49] In the 1970s, to get around radio obscenity restrictions, funk artists would use words that sounded like non-allowed words and double entendres to get around these restrictions.[62] For example, The Ohio Players had a song entitled \"Fopp\" which referred to \"Fopp me right, don't you fopp me wrong/We'll be foppin' all night long...\".[62] Some funk songs used made-up words which suggested that they were \"writing lyrics in a constant haze of marijuana smoke\", such as Parliament's \"Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)\", which includes words such as \"bioaquadoloop\".[62] The mainstream white listener base was often not able to understand funk's lyrical messages, which contributed to funk's lack of popular music chart success with white audiences during the 1970s.[63]"], "reference": "Funk horn sections often included saxophone (often tenor sax), trumpet, trombone, and for larger horn sections, a baritone sax.

Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead and backing vocalists, an especially tense vocal sound, and occasional improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds.[3] Soul music is known for reflecting African-American identity and stressing the importance of African-American culture. Soul has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues,[4] and primarily combines elements of gospel, R&B and jazz.[5] The genre emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry, as a newfound consciousness led to the creation of music that boasted pride in being black.[6][7] Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, and American record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in its proliferation during the civil rights movement. Soul also became popular worldwide, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.[8] It had a resurgence in the mid-to late 1990s with the subgenre neo soul,[9] which incorporated modern production elements and hip hop influences. Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Many prominent soul artists, including Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and various acts under the Motown label, such as The Supremes and The Temptations, were highly influential in the genre's development and all gained widespread popularity during this time.[10] By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists moved to funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more socially conscious varieties.[11] By the early 1970s, soul music had begun to absorb influences from psychedelic rock and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to the creation of psychedelic soul and progressive soul. Prominent soul artists of this era include Marvin Gaye, Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, Al Green, and Bill Withers. Meshell Ndegeocello, Joi,[70] Bilal, Dwele, Anthony David,[71] Janelle MonÃ¡e,[72] and the Soulquarians, an experimental black-music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s.[73] Psychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of funk music a few years later.[74] Early pioneers of this subgenre of soul music include Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Norman Whitfield, and Isaac Hayes.[75] While psychedelic rock began its decline, the influence of psychedelic soul continued on and remained prevalent through the 1970s.[76][failed verification] In the early 1960s, small soul scenes began popping up around the UK. Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry. As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market.[77] Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly the Beatles.[78] There were a handful of significant British blue-eyed soul acts, including Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones.[79] In the 1970s Carl Douglas, the Real Thing and Delegation[80] had hits in the UK. American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the mod,", "<2-hop>\n\nsong directly based on a gospel hymn.[11] By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King, and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including Stax artists such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, who mainly recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. According to Jon Landau: Between 1962 and 1964 Redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home... He soon became known as \"Mr. Pitiful\" and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads.[33] The most important female soul singer to emerge was Aretha Franklin, originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalized by her recordings for Atlantic. Her 1967 recordings, such as \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\", \"Respect\" (written and originally recorded by Otis Redding), and \"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\" (written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn), were significant and commercially successful recordings.[34][35][36][37] Soul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. Otis Redding was a huge success at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.[11] The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. \"Soul\" became an umbrella term for an increasingly wide variety of R&B-based music styles â€“ from the dance and pop-oriented acts at Motown Records in Detroit, such as the Temptations, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, to \"deep soul\" performers such as Percy Sledge and James Carr.[38][39][40] Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.[16][41] By 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into different subgenres. Artists such as James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone evolved into funk music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield and Al Green developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre.[11] However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.[16] Mitchell's Hi Records continued in the Stax tradition of the previous decade, releasing a string of hits by Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright and Syl Johnson.[42] Bobby Womack, who recorded with Chips Moman in the late 1960s, continued to produce soul recordings in the 1970s and 1980s.[43][44] In Detroit, producer Don Davis worked with Stax artists such as Johnnie Taylor and the Dramatics.[45] Early 1970s recordings by the Detroit Emeralds, such as Do Me Right, are a link between soul and the later disco style.[46] Motown Records artists such as Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson contributed to the evolution of soul music, although their recordings were considered more in a pop music vein than those of Redding, Franklin and Carr.[38] Although stylistically different from classic soul music, recordings by Chicago-based artists are often considered part of the genre.[47] By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres.[48] Artists like James Brown led soul towards funk music, which became typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic and the Meters.[49] More versatile groups such as War, the Commodores, and Earth, Wind and Fire became popular around this time.[50] During the 1970s, some slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates and Oakland's Tower of Power achieved mainstream success, as did a new generation of street-corner harmony or \"city-soul\" groups such as the Delfonics and the historically black Howard University's Unifics.[51][52] The syndicated music/dance variety television series Soul Train, hosted by Chicago native Don Cornelius, debuted in 1971.[53] The show provided an outlet for soul music for several decades, also spawning a franchise that saw the creation of a record label (Soul Train Records) that distributed music by the Whispers, Carrie Lucas, and an up-and-coming group known as Shalamar.[54] Numerous disputes led to Cornelius spinning off the record label to his talent booker, Dick Griffey, who transformed the label into Solar Records, itself a prominent soul music label throughout the 1980s.[54] The TV series continued to air until 2006, although other predominantly African-American music genres such as hip-hop began overshadowing soul on the show beginning in the 1980s.[55] As disco and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from fusion and adult contemporary. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, the Commodores and Con Funk Shun would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, Peabo Bryson, Chaka Khan, and Larry Graham. After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style that is known as contemporary R&B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994. Berry Gordy's successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were Gladys Knight & the Pips, the Supremes, the Temptations, the Miracles, the Four Tops, the Marvelettes, Mary Wells, Jr. Walker & the All-Stars, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, Martha and the Vandellas,[56] and the Jackson 5. Hits were made using a quasi-industrial \"assembly line\" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes.

In addition to Parliament Funkadelic, artists like Sly and the Family Stone, Rufus & Chaka Khan, Bootsy's Rubber Band, the Isley Brothers, Ohio Players, Con Funk Shun, Kool and the Gang, the Bar-Kays, Commodores, Roy Ayers, Curtis Mayfield, and Stevie Wonder, among others, got radio play. Disco music owed a great deal to funk. Many early disco songs and performers came directly from funk-oriented backgrounds. Some disco music hits, such as all of Barry White's hits, \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Biddu and Carl Douglas, Donna Summer's \"Love To Love You Baby\", Diana Ross' \"Love Hangover\", KC and the Sunshine Band's \"I'm Your Boogie Man\", \"I'm Every Woman\" by Chaka Khan (also known as the Queen of Funk), and Chic's \"Le Freak\" conspicuously include riffs and rhythms derived from funk. In 1976, Rose Royce scored a number-one hit with a purely dance-funk record, \"Car Wash\". Even with the arrival of disco, funk became increasingly popular well into the early 1980s. Funk music was also exported to Africa, and it melded with African singing and rhythms to form Afrobeat. Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, who was heavily influenced by James Brown's music, is credited with creating the style and terming it \"Afrobeat\". Jazz-funk is a subgenre of jazz music characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds[83] and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.[84] Jazz-funk is primarily an American genre, where it was popular throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, but it also achieved noted appeal on the club circuit in England during the mid-1970s. Similar genres include soul jazz and jazz fusion, but neither entirely overlap with jazz-funk. Notably jazz-funk is less vocal, more arranged and featured more improvisation than soul jazz, and retains a strong feel of groove and R&B versus some of the jazz fusion production. In the 1980s, largely as a reaction against what was seen as the over-indulgence of disco, many of the core elements that formed the foundation of the P-Funk formula began to be usurped by electronic instruments, drum machines and synthesizers. Horn sections of saxophones and trumpets were replaced by synth keyboards, and the horns that remained were given simplified lines, and few horn solos were given to soloists. The classic electric keyboards of funk, like the Hammond B3 organ, the Hohner Clavinet and/or the Fender Rhodes piano, began to be replaced by the new digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 and microprocessor-controlled analog synthesizers like the Prophet-5 and Oberheim OB-X. Electronic drum machines such as the Roland TR-808, Linn LM-1, and Oberheim DMX began to replace the \"funky drummers\" of the past, and the slap and pop style of bass playing were often replaced by synth keyboard basslines. Lyrics of funk songs began to change from suggestive double entendres to more graphic and sexually explicit content. Influenced by Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra, American hip hop DJ Afrika Bambaataa developed electro-funk, a minimalist machine-driven style of funk with his single \"Planet Rock\" in 1982.[85][86] Also known simply as electro, this style of funk was driven by synthesizers and the electronic rhythm of the TR-808 drum machine. The single \"Renegades of Funk\" followed in 1983.[85] Michael Jackson was also influenced by electro-funk.[87] In the 1980s, techno-funk music used the TR-808 programmable drum machine,[88] while Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra influenced electro-funk artists such as Afrika Bambaataa and Mantronix.[86][89]", "<2-hop>\n\nFunk is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of various music genres that were popular among African-Americans in the mid-20th century. It deemphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a percussionist, often at slower tempos than other popular music. Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that create a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable\" feel.[3] It uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, and dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths. Funk originated in the mid-1960s, with James Brown's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeatâ€”with a heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure (\"The One\"), and the application of swung 16th notes and syncopation on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs.[4] Rock- and psychedelia-influenced musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic fostered more eclectic examples of the genre beginning in the late 1960s.[5] Other musical groups developed Brown's innovations during the 1970s and the 1980s, including Kool and the Gang,[6] Ohio Players, Fatback Band, Jimmy Castor Bunch, Earth, Wind & Fire, B.T.
