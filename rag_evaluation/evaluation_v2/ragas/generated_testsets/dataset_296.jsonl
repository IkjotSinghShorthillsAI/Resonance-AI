{"user_input": "Tell me about the band Defunkt within the context of NYC dance-punk.", "reference_contexts": ["Dance-punk (also known as punk-funk[citation needed]) is a post-punk subgenre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the disco, post-disco and new wave movements.[2] The genre is characterized by mixing the energy of punk rock with the danceable rhythms of funk and disco. It was most prominent in the New York City punk movement. Many groups in the post-punk era adopted a more danceable style. These bands were influenced by funk, disco, new wave, and other dance music popular at the time (as well as being anticipated by some artists from the 1970s including Sparks and Iggy Pop). Influential acts from the 1980s included Talking Heads, Public Image Ltd.,[3][4] New Order[5] and Gang of Four.[2][4][6] New York City dance-punk included Defunkt, Lizzy Mercier Descloux, Material,[7] James Chance and the Contortions,[2] Cristina Monet, Bush Tetras, ESG, and Liquid Liquid.[8] German punk singer Nina Hagen had an underground dance hit in 1983 with \"New York / N.Y.\", which mixed her searing punk (and opera) vocals with disco beats.[2] In the late 1970s, as the no wave movement grew in reaction to commercial new wave, punk bands such as James Chance and the Contortions, ESG and Liquid Liquid began to experiment with a more dance-friendly sound. Dance punk peaked in the early 1980s and then began to decline until the late 1990s, when it experienced a resurgence. Among the first relevant bands to exploit the genre were Leeds' Gang of Four, New York's Talking Heads, New Order (formerly Joy Division) and Public Image.[9] Dance-punk emerges as a compromised genre. Its first wave came about in response to the systemic shifts caused by late capitalism and neoliberalism. Its primary objective was to create a communal and alternative scene as a critique of the growing emphasis on neoliberal competition and private accumulation. The second wave of dance-punk materialized in an urban landscape characterized by the presence of the hipster figure, deeply entrenched in creative industries, operating in the symbolic realm rather than the manufactured, and accumulating subcultural capital.[10] Emerging from the convergence of disco and punk influences, dance-punk exhibits a strong affiliation with urban environments, particularly in the way they are romanticized and portrayed. These spaces, whether they exist in the realm of imagination or reality, conjure up a sense of cosmopolitanism, artistic liberation, and a spirit of defiance against the confines of conventional mainstream culture.[10] The dance-punk genre, spanning both its first and second waves, occupies a nuanced position along a stylistic spectrum rather than adhering to a rigid set of defining characteristics.[11] Categorizing dance-punk becomes increasingly complex as certain bands proclaim allegiance to a punk \"attitude\" while crafting music that leans more towards electronic dance genres. Notably, as a subgenre emerging from the broader post-punk movement, dance-punk shares several common features. These features include \"dour (male) vocals with erudite or self-conscious lyrics, accompanied by metallic-sounding, distorted electric guitars playing texturally, not melodically; an accelerated disco beat or dance groove; a melodic bass line; and echoing sound effects borrowed from dub-reggae.\"[10] One of the most notable features of dance-punk is a deliberate emphasis on the effective use of space and silence. This approach involves creating minimalist rhythms, avoiding extended guitar solos and deliberately 'stripping back' the sound. Within dance punk, minimalism is not just about simplicity; it signifies a sense of directness and systematic order, often drawing parallels with the purity associated with the clean lines and abstractions of modernist art.[10] The guitar sound in dance punk takes on a unique quality characterized by angularity - a clean and brittle spikiness that departs from traditional riffing or bluesy chords. This sonic approach aligns the guitar sound with abstract shapes and architectural elements reminiscent of Constructivism, Suprematism and the Bauhaus movement.[10] Prominent groove and syncopation are integral to the rhythm of dance punk. The genre strives to create a groove that is fluid, smooth and trance-like, offering an escape from the metrical constraints of capitalism. The groove, with its syncopations, introduces elements of human flexibility and unpredictability, giving the music an affective dimension that is felt rather than intellectually grasped. Syncopation, a key component, involves shifting and eliminating predictable accents, aligning rhythms more with speech and orality, emphasizing the human element over mechanistic precision.[10] \"Dryness” is a term often used to describe the sonic quality of dance punk. It denotes a lack of sweetness, warmth, emotion and softness, and conveys a reserved, sardonic and ironic manner. This sense of dryness extends beyond the sound to the lyrics and vocals, particularly in the dance-punk of the 2000s, where it becomes a defining sonic quality, characterized by ironic lyrics and flat vocal delivery.[9] The lyrical aspect of dance punk sets it apart from many other dance genres. It often adheres to verse-chorus or narrative structures more common in rock music. At its most dance-influenced, however, dance punk uses repetitive phrases to create a trance-like, transcendent effect. This approach has similarities to disco singing, where the repetition of phrases serves to empty language and open the self to divine inspiration through heightened emotional expression.[10] In the 70s, when dance punk emerged, punk bands tried to rebel against society. In the punk scene, rebellion was often expressed through violent dance styles such as thrashing, characterized by head bobbing, flailing arms and exaggeratedly aggressive and energetic movements, and pogo dancing, characterized by jumping in a crowd by throwing oneself against other people. Punk dancing was an amalgamation of these two styles.[12] Although dance-punk faded with the rise of new pop in the early 1980s, it made a comeback in the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of the post-punk revival. Dance-punk bands emerged from the pop-punk and garage rock revivals of the late 1990s.[13] Well-known are acts such as LCD Soundsystem, Clinic, Death from Above 1979, !!!, Hockey, Liars, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Hot Heat, Foals, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Le Tigre, Bloc Party, Kasabian, You Say Party, Electric Six, the Faint, Arctic Monkeys, the Rapture, Shout Out Out Out Out, and Radio 4, joined by dance-oriented"], "reference": "New York City dance-punk included Defunkt, Lizzy Mercier Descloux, Material, James Chance and the Contortions, Cristina Monet, Bush Tetras, ESG, and Liquid Liquid.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

The first use of \"PBR&B\" was on Twitter by Sound of the City writer Eric Harvey in a 2011 post.[17][18][19] Three years later, amazed and distressed at how far the term—meant as a joke—had traveled, Harvey wrote an extensive essay about it for Pitchfork.[20] Slate suggests the name \"R-Neg-B\", as a reference to \"negging.\"[21] The genre has sometimes been called \"noir&B.\"[22][23] However, the terms are often criticized for \"pigeonholing\" artists into hipster subculture and being used in a derisive manner.[24][25] Barry Walters of Spin characterizes the unconventional style as an \"exchange between EDM, rock, hip hop and R&B's commercial avant-garde\", and cites Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak, Frank Ocean's Nostalgia, Ultra and Channel Orange, the Weeknd's 2011 trilogy of mixtapes, Drake's Take Care, Miguel's Kaleidoscope Dream, Holy Other's Held and How to Dress Well's Total Loss as works associated with alternative R&B.[7] AllMusic's Andy Kellman cites the early albums of Bilal—1st Born Second and Love for Sale—as antecedents to the \"left-field R&B\" that developed in the late 2000s.[26] According to Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, the Soulquarians collective of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which Bilal was a part of, \"corral[ed] leaders of the alternative R&B movement like the Roots and D'Angelo\".[27] Janet Jackson's sixth studio album The Velvet Rope (1997) is cited as one of the genre's stylistic origins.[28][29] Dee Lockett from Slate credits Aaliyah's musical style on her second studio album \"One in a Million\" for \"giving rise to a new subgenre, loosely referred to as experimental R&B (or \"PBR&B\")\".[3] While NPR writer Stasia Irons stated Aaliyah's self-titled album \"became a catalyst and bridge that created a smooth transition from '90s style R&B into Modern PBR&B\".[30] Brandon Neasman of The Grio observes a \"changing of the guard in R&B, from the smooth, cool heartthrobs to these vulnerable, off-kilter personalities\" amid the prevalence of social media in society.[31] Neasman finds the subject matter of \"these new-wave artists\" to be more \"relatable\" and writes of alternative R&B's characteristics: [A] lot of the production is echo-laden and lofty, often using many synthesizers and filtered drums—sonically giving a nod to Prince's vintage '80s sound. Additionally, for the most part, it doesn't feel as if these artists are selling sex as their main entrée. Granted, they still sing about the topic, and in explicit detail, but it's in equal proportion to drugs, spirituality and personal philosophies. You don't get that same diversity in subject matter from the majority of modern R&B singers.[31] Hermione Hoby of The Guardian writes that \"the music is quietly radical\" and observes \"an ongoing, mutually enriching dialogue between indie and electronic musicians and R&B artists.\"[16] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times feels that \"the new movement feels like the most significant stylistic change in R&B since neo soul rolled around in the 1990s.\"[32] There are two predominating opinions regarding alternative R&B as a classifier of sonic and lyrical characteristics within the larger R&B genre, the first of the two being a reluctant acceptance of its existence—if only for the sake of marketability. Stereogum described the genre as a group of \"co-conspirators, not a unified movement.\"[4] Similarly in thought, How to Dress Well, while not offended by the term \"PBR&B\", finds it \"tacky\"; in an interview with Complex, he points out that \"if you put records [released by other alternative R&B artists] side-by-side, me and whoever, like you're just not going to [hear] the same sounds, period\", before proceeding to cite Miguel as an example.[33] Miguel himself has said that he is \"comfortable\" with the term \"indie R&B\" because it \"insinuates a higher art. Or a deeper or somehow more artistic delivery of rhythm and blues music. It suggests there's more artistry within a genre that has become more of a cliché of itself.\"[34] Frank Ocean, when first asked in an interview with The Quietus, whether he considers \"Novacane\" to be an R&B song, responded, \"You're limiting it. And that's why I always say that about the genre thing, because that's what it does. When you say 'it's that', you listen to it in a certain way. And you might not necessarily miss it, but it's just inaccurate, and you'll miss a couple of things, contextually.\"[35] He proceeds to point out that race and vocal delivery are stereotypical signifiers of R&B music, in turn forcing himself and his peers into a category they may not identify within; when considering Nostalgia, Ultra Ocean argues that if he were a different complexion, \"people would listen to it and be like 'Yeah, he borrowed from R&B but it's just not R&B—it's a lot of things, and you can't just call it 'R&B.'\"[35] Ocean also uses alternative R&B for challenging norms in hegemonic masculinity. Channel Orange has prevalent queer-coded lyrics and scenarios within the characters he portrays.[36] In an interview with The Guardian, FKA Twigs rejected the term by declaring, \"Fuck alternative R&B!\" She further explained: \"It's just because I'm mixed race. When I first released", "<2-hop>\n\nDance-punk (also known as punk-funk[citation needed]) is a post-punk subgenre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the disco, post-disco and new wave movements.[2] The genre is characterized by mixing the energy of punk rock with the danceable rhythms of funk and disco. It was most prominent in the New York City punk movement. Many groups in the post-punk era adopted a more danceable style. These bands were influenced by funk, disco, new wave, and other dance music popular at the time (as well as being anticipated by some artists from the 1970s including Sparks and Iggy Pop). Influential acts from the 1980s included Talking Heads, Public Image Ltd.,[3][4] New Order[5] and Gang of Four.[2][4][6] New York City dance-punk included Defunkt, Lizzy Mercier Descloux, Material,[7] James Chance and the Contortions,[2] Cristina Monet, Bush Tetras, ESG, and Liquid Liquid.[8] German punk singer Nina Hagen had an underground dance hit in 1983 with \"New York / N.Y.\", which mixed her searing punk (and opera) vocals with disco beats.[2] In the late 1970s, as the no wave movement grew in reaction to commercial new wave, punk bands such as James Chance and the Contortions, ESG and Liquid Liquid began to experiment with a more dance-friendly sound. Dance punk peaked in the early 1980s and then began to decline until the late 1990s, when it experienced a resurgence. Among the first relevant bands to exploit the genre were Leeds' Gang of Four, New York's Talking Heads, New Order (formerly Joy Division) and Public Image.[9] Dance-punk emerges as a compromised genre. Its first wave came about in response to the systemic shifts caused by late capitalism and neoliberalism. Its primary objective was to create a communal and alternative scene as a critique of the growing emphasis on neoliberal competition and private accumulation. The second wave of dance-punk materialized in an urban landscape characterized by the presence of the hipster figure, deeply entrenched in creative industries, operating in the symbolic realm rather than the manufactured, and accumulating subcultural capital.[10] Emerging from the convergence of disco and punk influences, dance-punk exhibits a strong affiliation with urban environments, particularly in the way they are romanticized and portrayed. These spaces, whether they exist in the realm of imagination or reality, conjure up a sense of cosmopolitanism, artistic liberation, and a spirit of defiance against the confines of conventional mainstream culture.[10] The dance-punk genre, spanning both its first and second waves, occupies a nuanced position along a stylistic spectrum rather than adhering to a rigid set of defining characteristics.[11] Categorizing dance-punk becomes increasingly complex as certain bands proclaim allegiance to a punk \"attitude\" while crafting music that leans more towards electronic dance genres. Notably, as a subgenre emerging from the broader post-punk movement, dance-punk shares several common features. These features include \"dour (male) vocals with erudite or self-conscious lyrics, accompanied by metallic-sounding, distorted electric guitars playing texturally, not melodically; an accelerated disco beat or dance groove; a melodic bass line; and echoing sound effects borrowed from dub-reggae.\"[10] One of the most notable features of dance-punk is a deliberate emphasis on the effective use of space and silence. This approach involves creating minimalist rhythms, avoiding extended guitar solos and deliberately 'stripping back' the sound. Within dance punk, minimalism is not just about simplicity; it signifies a sense of directness and systematic order, often drawing parallels with the purity associated with the clean lines and abstractions of modernist art.[10] The guitar sound in dance punk takes on a unique quality characterized by angularity - a clean and brittle spikiness that departs from traditional riffing or bluesy chords. This sonic approach aligns the guitar sound with abstract shapes and architectural elements reminiscent of Constructivism, Suprematism and the Bauhaus movement.[10] Prominent groove and syncopation are integral to the rhythm of dance punk. The genre strives to create a groove that is fluid, smooth and trance-like, offering an escape from the metrical constraints of capitalism. The groove, with its syncopations, introduces elements of human flexibility and unpredictability, giving the music an affective dimension that is felt rather than intellectually grasped. Syncopation, a key component, involves shifting and eliminating predictable accents, aligning rhythms more with speech and orality, emphasizing the human element over mechanistic precision.[10] \"Dryness” is a term often used to describe the sonic quality of dance punk. It denotes a lack of sweetness, warmth, emotion and softness, and conveys a reserved, sardonic and ironic manner. This sense of dryness extends beyond the sound to the lyrics and vocals, particularly in the dance-punk of the 2000s, where it becomes a defining sonic quality, characterized by ironic lyrics and flat vocal delivery.[9] The lyrical aspect of dance punk sets it apart from many other dance genres. It often adheres to verse-chorus or narrative structures more common in rock music. At its most dance-influenced, however, dance punk uses repetitive phrases to create a trance-like, transcendent effect. This approach has similarities to disco singing, where the repetition of phrases serves to empty language and open the self to divine inspiration through heightened emotional expression.[10] In the 70s, when dance punk emerged, punk bands tried to rebel against society. In the punk scene, rebellion was often expressed through violent dance styles such as thrashing, characterized by head bobbing, flailing arms and exaggeratedly aggressive and energetic movements, and pogo dancing, characterized by jumping in a crowd by throwing oneself against other people. Punk dancing was an amalgamation of these two styles.[12] Although dance-punk faded with the rise of new pop in the early 1980s, it made a comeback in the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of the post-punk revival. Dance-punk bands emerged from the pop-punk and garage rock revivals of the late 1990s.[13] Well-known are acts such as LCD Soundsystem, Clinic, Death from Above 1979, !!!, Hockey, Liars, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Hot Heat, Foals, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Le Tigre, Bloc Party, Kasabian, You Say Party, Electric Six, the Faint, Arctic Monkeys, the Rapture, Shout Out Out Out Out, and Radio 4, joined by dance-oriented", "<3-hop>\n\nacts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud.[14] In the early 2000s Washington, D.C. had a popular and notable punk-funk scene, inspired by Fugazi, post-punk, and go-go acts like Trouble Funk and Rare Essence, including bands like Q and Not U, Black Eyes, and Baltimore's Oxes, Double Dagger, and Dope Body. In Britain the combination of indie with dance-punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands[15] including Trash Fashion,[16] New Young Pony Club,[17] Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles,[18] and Shitdisco[15] forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier raves.[15][19]"], "reference": "Dance-punk emerged as a post-punk subgenre in the late 1970s, closely associated with disco, post-disco, and new wave movements.

The first use of \"PBR&B\" was on Twitter by Sound of the City writer Eric Harvey in a 2011 post.[17][18][19] Three years later, amazed and distressed at how far the term—meant as a joke—had traveled, Harvey wrote an extensive essay about it for Pitchfork.[20] Slate suggests the name \"R-Neg-B\", as a reference to \"negging.\"[21] The genre has sometimes been called \"noir&B.\"[22][23] However, the terms are often criticized for \"pigeonholing\" artists into hipster subculture and being used in a derisive manner.[24][25] Barry Walters of Spin characterizes the unconventional style as an \"exchange between EDM, rock, hip hop and R&B's commercial avant-garde\", and cites Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak, Frank Ocean's Nostalgia, Ultra and Channel Orange, the Weeknd's 2011 trilogy of mixtapes, Drake's Take Care, Miguel's Kaleidoscope Dream, Holy Other's Held and How to Dress Well's Total Loss as works associated with alternative R&B.[7] AllMusic's Andy Kellman cites the early albums of Bilal—1st Born Second and Love for Sale—as antecedents to the \"left-field R&B\" that developed in the late 2000s.[26] According to Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, the Soulquarians collective of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which Bilal was a part of, \"corral[ed] leaders of the alternative R&B movement like the Roots and D'Angelo\".[27] Janet Jackson's sixth studio album The Velvet Rope (1997) is cited as one of the genre's stylistic origins.[28][29] Dee Lockett from Slate credits Aaliyah's musical style on her second studio album \"One in a Million\" for \"giving rise to a new subgenre, loosely referred to as experimental R&B (or \"PBR&B\")\".[3] While NPR writer Stasia Irons stated Aaliyah's self-titled album \"became a catalyst and bridge that created a smooth transition from '90s style R&B into Modern PBR&B\".[30] Brandon Neasman of The Grio observes a \"changing of the guard in R&B, from the smooth, cool heartthrobs to these vulnerable, off-kilter personalities\" amid the prevalence of social media in society.[31] Neasman finds the subject matter of \"these new-wave artists\" to be more \"relatable\" and writes of alternative R&B's characteristics: [A] lot of the production is echo-laden and lofty, often using many synthesizers and filtered drums—sonically giving a nod to Prince's vintage '80s sound.

Or a deeper or somehow more artistic delivery of rhythm and blues music. It suggests there's more artistry within a genre that has become more of a cliché of itself.\"[34] Frank Ocean, when first asked in an interview with The Quietus, whether he considers \"Novacane\" to be an R&B song, responded, \"You're limiting it. And that's why I always say that about the genre thing, because that's what it does. When you say 'it's that', you listen to it in a certain way. And you might not necessarily miss it, but it's just inaccurate, and you'll miss a couple of things, contextually.\"[35] He proceeds to point out that race and vocal delivery are stereotypical signifiers of R&B music, in turn forcing himself and his peers into a category they may not identify within; when considering Nostalgia, Ultra Ocean argues that if he were a different complexion, \"people would listen to it and be like 'Yeah, he borrowed from R&B but it's just not R&B—it's a lot of things, and you can't just call it 'R&B.'\"[35] Ocean also uses alternative R&B for challenging norms in hegemonic masculinity. Channel Orange has prevalent queer-coded lyrics and scenarios within the characters he portrays.[36] In an interview with The Guardian, FKA Twigs rejected the term by declaring, \"Fuck alternative R&B!\" She further explained: \"It's just because I'm mixed race. When I first released", "<2-hop>\n\nDance-punk (also known as punk-funk[citation needed]) is a post-punk subgenre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the disco, post-disco and new wave movements.[2] The genre is characterized by mixing the energy of punk rock with the danceable rhythms of funk and disco. It was most prominent in the New York City punk movement. Many groups in the post-punk era adopted a more danceable style. These bands were influenced by funk, disco, new wave, and other dance music popular at the time (as well as being anticipated by some artists from the 1970s including Sparks and Iggy Pop). Influential acts from the 1980s included Talking Heads, Public Image Ltd.,[3][4] New Order[5] and Gang of Four.[2][4][6] New York City dance-punk included Defunkt, Lizzy Mercier Descloux, Material,[7] James Chance and the Contortions,[2] Cristina Monet, Bush Tetras, ESG, and Liquid Liquid.[8] German punk singer Nina Hagen had an underground dance hit in 1983 with \"New York / N.Y.\", which mixed her searing punk (and opera) vocals with disco beats.[2] In the late 1970s, as the no wave movement grew in reaction to commercial new wave, punk bands such as James Chance and the Contortions, ESG and Liquid Liquid began to experiment with a more dance-friendly sound. Dance punk peaked in the early 1980s and then began to decline until the late 1990s, when it experienced a resurgence. Among the first relevant bands to exploit the genre were Leeds' Gang of Four, New York's Talking Heads, New Order (formerly Joy Division) and Public Image.[9] Dance-punk emerges as a compromised genre. Its first wave came about in response to the systemic shifts caused by late capitalism and neoliberalism. Its primary objective was to create a communal and alternative scene as a critique of the growing emphasis on neoliberal competition and private accumulation. The second wave of dance-punk materialized in an urban landscape characterized by the presence of the hipster figure, deeply entrenched in creative industries, operating in the symbolic realm rather than the manufactured, and accumulating subcultural capital.[10] Emerging from the convergence of disco and punk influences, dance-punk exhibits a strong affiliation with urban environments, particularly in the way they are romanticized and portrayed. These spaces, whether they exist in the realm of imagination or reality, conjure up a sense of cosmopolitanism, artistic liberation, and a spirit of defiance against the confines of conventional mainstream culture.[10] The dance-punk genre, spanning both its first and second waves, occupies a nuanced position along a stylistic spectrum rather than adhering to a rigid set of defining characteristics.[11] Categorizing dance-punk becomes increasingly complex as certain bands proclaim allegiance to a punk \"attitude\" while crafting music that leans more towards electronic dance genres. Notably, as a subgenre emerging from the broader post-punk movement, dance-punk shares several common features. These features include \"dour (male) vocals with erudite or self-conscious lyrics, accompanied by metallic-sounding, distorted electric guitars playing texturally, not melodically; an accelerated disco beat or dance groove; a melodic bass line; and echoing sound effects borrowed from dub-reggae.\"[10] One of the most notable features of dance-punk is a deliberate emphasis on the effective use of space and silence. This approach involves creating minimalist rhythms, avoiding extended guitar solos and deliberately 'stripping back' the sound. Within dance punk, minimalism is not just about simplicity; it signifies a sense of directness and systematic order, often drawing parallels with the purity associated with the clean lines and abstractions of modernist art.[10] The guitar sound in dance punk takes on a unique quality characterized by angularity - a clean and brittle spikiness that departs from traditional riffing or bluesy chords. This sonic approach aligns the guitar sound with abstract shapes and architectural elements reminiscent of Constructivism, Suprematism and the Bauhaus movement.[10] Prominent groove and syncopation are integral to the rhythm of dance punk. The genre strives to create a groove that is fluid, smooth and trance-like, offering an escape from the metrical constraints of capitalism. The groove, with its syncopations, introduces elements of human flexibility and unpredictability, giving the music an affective dimension that is felt rather than intellectually grasped. Syncopation, a key component, involves shifting and eliminating predictable accents, aligning rhythms more with speech and orality, emphasizing the human element over mechanistic precision.[10] \"Dryness” is a term often used to describe the sonic quality of dance punk. It denotes a lack of sweetness, warmth, emotion and softness, and conveys a reserved, sardonic and ironic manner. This sense of dryness extends beyond the sound to the lyrics and vocals, particularly in the dance-punk of the 2000s, where it becomes a defining sonic quality, characterized by ironic lyrics and flat vocal delivery.[9] The lyrical aspect of dance punk sets it apart from many other dance genres. It often adheres to verse-chorus or narrative structures more common in rock music. At its most dance-influenced, however, dance punk uses repetitive phrases to create a trance-like, transcendent effect. This approach has similarities to disco singing, where the repetition of phrases serves to empty language and open the self to divine inspiration through heightened emotional expression.[10] In the 70s, when dance punk emerged, punk bands tried to rebel against society. In the punk scene, rebellion was often expressed through violent dance styles such as thrashing, characterized by head bobbing, flailing arms and exaggeratedly aggressive and energetic movements, and pogo dancing, characterized by jumping in a crowd by throwing oneself against other people. Punk dancing was an amalgamation of these two styles.[12] Although dance-punk faded with the rise of new pop in the early 1980s, it made a comeback in the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of the post-punk revival. Dance-punk bands emerged from the pop-punk and garage rock revivals of the late 1990s.[13] Well-known are acts such as LCD Soundsystem, Clinic, Death from Above 1979, !!!, Hockey, Liars, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Hot Heat, Foals, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Le Tigre, Bloc Party, Kasabian, You Say Party, Electric Six, the Faint, Arctic Monkeys, the Rapture, Shout Out Out Out Out, and Radio 4, joined by dance-oriented", "<3-hop>\n\nacts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud.[14] In the early 2000s Washington, D.C. had a popular and notable punk-funk scene, inspired by Fugazi, post-punk, and go-go acts like Trouble Funk and Rare Essence, including bands like Q and Not U, Black Eyes, and Baltimore's Oxes, Double Dagger, and Dope Body. In Britain the combination of indie with dance-punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands[15] including Trash Fashion,[16] New Young Pony Club,[17] Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles,[18] and Shitdisco[15] forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier raves.[15][19]"], "reference": "Dance-punk is a post-punk subgenre mixing punk rock with funk and disco rhythms.

The first use of \"PBR&B\" was on Twitter by Sound of the City writer Eric Harvey in a 2011 post.[17][18][19] Three years later, amazed and distressed at how far the term—meant as a joke—had traveled, Harvey wrote an extensive essay about it for Pitchfork.[20] Slate suggests the name \"R-Neg-B\", as a reference to \"negging.\"[21] The genre has sometimes been called \"noir&B.\"[22][23] However, the terms are often criticized for \"pigeonholing\" artists into hipster subculture and being used in a derisive manner.[24][25] Barry Walters of Spin characterizes the unconventional style as an \"exchange between EDM, rock, hip hop and R&B's commercial avant-garde\", and cites Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak, Frank Ocean's Nostalgia, Ultra and Channel Orange, the Weeknd's 2011 trilogy of mixtapes, Drake's Take Care, Miguel's Kaleidoscope Dream, Holy Other's Held and How to Dress Well's Total Loss as works associated with alternative R&B.[7] AllMusic's Andy Kellman cites the early albums of Bilal—1st Born Second and Love for Sale—as antecedents to the \"left-field R&B\" that developed in the late 2000s.[26] According to Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, the Soulquarians collective of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which Bilal was a part of, \"corral[ed] leaders of the alternative R&B movement like the Roots and D'Angelo\".[27] Janet Jackson's sixth studio album The Velvet Rope (1997) is cited as one of the genre's stylistic origins.[28][29] Dee Lockett from Slate credits Aaliyah's musical style on her second studio album \"One in a Million\" for \"giving rise to a new subgenre, loosely referred to as experimental R&B (or \"PBR&B\")\".[3] While NPR writer Stasia Irons stated Aaliyah's self-titled album \"became a catalyst and bridge that created a smooth transition from '90s style R&B into Modern PBR&B\".[30] Brandon Neasman of The Grio observes a \"changing of the guard in R&B, from the smooth, cool heartthrobs to these vulnerable, off-kilter personalities\" amid the prevalence of social media in society.[31] Neasman finds the subject matter of \"these new-wave artists\" to be more \"relatable\" and writes of alternative R&B's characteristics: [A] lot of the production is echo-laden and lofty, often using many synthesizers and filtered drums—sonically giving a nod to Prince's vintage '80s sound. Additionally, for the most part, it doesn't feel as if these artists are selling sex as their main entrée. Granted, they still sing about the topic, and in explicit detail, but it's in equal proportion to drugs, spirituality and personal philosophies. You don't get that same diversity in subject matter from the majority of modern R&B singers.[31] Hermione Hoby of The Guardian writes that \"the music is quietly radical\" and observes \"an ongoing, mutually enriching dialogue between indie and electronic musicians and R&B artists.\"[16] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times feels that \"the new movement feels like the most significant stylistic change in R&B since neo soul rolled around in the 1990s.\"[32] There are two predominating opinions regarding alternative R&B as a classifier of sonic and lyrical characteristics within the larger R&B genre, the first of the two being a reluctant acceptance of its existence—if only for the sake of marketability. Stereogum described the genre as a group of \"co-conspirators, not a unified movement.\"[4] Similarly in thought, How to Dress Well, while not offended by the term \"PBR&B\", finds it \"tacky\"; in an interview with Complex, he points out that \"if you put records [released by other alternative R&B artists] side-by-side, me and whoever, like you're just not going to [hear] the same sounds, period\", before proceeding to cite Miguel as an example.[33] Miguel himself has said that he is \"comfortable\" with the term \"indie R&B\" because it \"insinuates a higher art. Or a deeper or somehow more artistic delivery of rhythm and blues music. It suggests there's more artistry within a genre that has become more of a cliché of itself.\"[34] Frank Ocean, when first asked in an interview with The Quietus, whether he considers \"Novacane\" to be an R&B song, responded, \"You're limiting it. And that's why I always say that about the genre thing, because that's what it does. When you say 'it's that', you listen to it in a certain way. And you might not necessarily miss it, but it's just inaccurate, and you'll miss a couple of things, contextually.\"[35] He proceeds to point out that race and vocal delivery are stereotypical signifiers of R&B music, in turn forcing himself and his peers into a category they may not identify within; when considering Nostalgia, Ultra Ocean argues that if he were a different complexion, \"people would listen to it and be like 'Yeah, he borrowed from R&B but it's just not R&B—it's a lot of things, and you can't just call it 'R&B.'\"[35] Ocean also uses alternative R&B for challenging norms in hegemonic masculinity. Channel Orange has prevalent queer-coded lyrics and scenarios within the characters he portrays.[36] In an interview with The Guardian, FKA Twigs rejected the term by declaring, \"Fuck alternative R&B!\" She further explained: \"It's just because I'm mixed race. When I first released", "<2-hop>\n\nmusic and no one knew what I looked like, I would read comments like: 'I've never heard anything like this before, it's not in a genre.' And then my picture came out six months later, now she's an R&B singer.'\"[37] The Fader echoes her sentiment, stating, \"By adding the prefix, it sidelines R&B itself by implying it's not experimental, boundary-pushing or intellectual. It throws side-eye at the genre, while at the same time claiming to have discovered something worthy within it.\"[1]"], "reference": "Artists associated with Alternative R&B music include Frank Ocean, Zayn Malik, Tyler, The Creator, Childish Gambino, Drake, The Weeknd, SZA, Tinashe, Khalid, Bryson Tiller, PartyNextDoor, Tory Lanez, and 6lack.
