{"user_input": "How did Lil Wayne influence drill music?", "reference_contexts": ["UK drill scene emerged in the mid-2010s and subsequently influenced some regional scenes around the world, including Brooklyn drill, which also gained mainstream popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s with artists like Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign.[27][28][29] The lyrics of drill tend to be adversarial and aggressive. The Guardian's Lucy Stehlik said, \"Nihilistic drill reflects real life where its squeaky-clean hip-hop counterparts have failed.\"[30] Drill lyrics strongly contrast with the subject matter of earlier Chicago rappers[31] and contemporary mainstream hip hop which at the time of drill's emergence tended to glorify and celebrate a rise to wealth.[32] Drill lyrics typically reflect life on the streets, and tend to be gritty, violent, realistic, and nihilistic. Drill rappers use a grim, deadpan delivery,[33] often filtered through Auto-Tune, influenced by the \"stoned, aimless warbling of Soulja Boy (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and Lil Wayne before him.\"[34] Atlanta-based rappers Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame were important influences on the drill scene.[35] Although it bears many similarities to trap music, the speed of a drill beat is generally slower, with a moderate tempo, having about 60 to 70 beats per minute.[36][37] Some producers work at double tempo, such as 120 to 140 beats per minute.[citation needed] Drillers tend to be young; many prominent musicians in the scene started getting attention while still in their teens.[38] One of the genre's most prominent musicians, Chief Keef, was 16 when he signed a multi-million dollar record contract with Interscope,[39] and in an extreme example, Lil Wayne co-signed the 13-year-old driller Lil Mouse.[40] Critics have noted drill rappers' lack of concern with metaphor or wordplay. Chief Keef said that his simplistic flow is a conscious stylistic choice: \"I know what I'm doing. I mastered it. And I don't even really use metaphors or punchlines. 'Cause I don't have to. But I could. ... I think that's doing too much. I'd rather just say what's going on right now. ... I don't really like metaphors or punchlines like that.\"[41] Whet Moser wrote that Keef's songs are \"lyrically, rhythmically, and emotionally diminished, which is why they sound so airless and claustrophobic ... It's not even fatalistic, because that would imply a self-consciousness, a moral consideration, that isn't there in the lyrics. It just is, over and over again.\"[42] A profile on the scene in The New York Times examined the genre's aggression: \"With rare exception this music is unmediated and raw and without bright spots, focused on anger and violence. The instinct is to call this tough, unforgiving and concrete-hard music joyless, but in truth it's exuberant in its darkness. Most of its practitioners are young and coming into their creative own against a backdrop of outrageous violence in Chicago, particularly among young people—dozens of teenagers have been killed in Chicago this year—and often related to gangs. (There's a long history of overlap between Chicago's gangs and Chicago's rap.) That their music is a symphony of ill-tempered threats shouldn't be a surprise.\"[32] Stehlik called drill production style the \"sonic cousin to skittish footwork, southern-fried hip-hop and the 808 trigger-finger of trap.\"[30] Young Chop is frequently identified by critics as the genre's most characteristic producer.[43][44][45] The sound of trap producer Lex Luger's music is a major influence on drill,[35][44][46] and Young Chop identified Shawty Redd, Drumma Boy, and Zaytoven as important precursors to drill.[45] Chicago drill is traditionally characterized by synth brass and bell melodic elements, use of the crash cymbal, and busy snare drum patterns.[47] UK drill production, which is commonly utilized in Brooklyn drill, is characterized by a faster BPM, 808s \"slides,\" and more syncopated drum rhythms—including the use of a sped-up tresillo rhythm in the hi hat patterns.[48] David Drake of Complex said drill is not defined by any particular production style, but \"is about the entirety of the culture: the lingo, the dances, the mentality, and the music, much of which originated in 'Dro City', a gang-defined territory of city blocks in the Woodlawn neighborhood.\"[49] In street slang, \"drill\" means to fight or retaliate, and \"can be used for anything from females getting dolled up to all out war in the streets.\"[50] Dro City rapper Pac Man, considered the stylistic originator and forefather of the subgenre, is credited as the first to apply the term to the local hip hop music.[49][50] Pac Man's 2010 track, \"It's a Drill,\" is the first instance of the term being connected to the genre.[51] Regarding drill rappers' use of early social media, musician Naledge stated that Drill rappers \"understood virality in a way that I believe goes unremarked in terms of their genius and their ability to use social media to garner large audiences\".[52] Rapper Drake described the drill scene as a major vehicle of the early 2010s rise of Chicago hip hop, and described the scene as a grassroots movement that had incubated in a closed, interlocking system: on the streets and through social media in a network of clubs and parties and amongst high schools.[35] Drill developed on the South Side of Chicago, in the midst of escalating violence and a homicide crisis. Mark Guarino wrote for Salon that the music grew during \"a shift from historic feuding between monolithic crime organizations controlling thousands of members each to intrapersonal squabbling and retaliatory conflicts among smaller hybrid groups whose control extends just a few blocks... The toughened reality of living in these neighborhoods is what shaped Drill music.\"[53] In the drill scene, rap conflict and gang conflict overlap, and many of the young rappers come from backgrounds with experience of violence.[32][54] The Independent's Sam Gould wrote that Chief Keef \"represents both a scary strain of current hip hop culture and a seriously alienated group within American society.\"[40] YouTube was a platform for many drill rappers to release their music videos on, and ultimately significantly contributed to the genre's popularity.[55] Chief Keef is considered the primary progenitor and popularizer of drill music, responsible for bringing it to the mainstream.[20] In 2011 and 2012, he recorded multiple"], "reference": "Drill rappers use a grim, deadpan delivery, often filtered through Auto-Tune, influenced by the \\\"stoned, aimless warbling of Soulja Boy (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and Lil Wayne before him.\\\" In an extreme example, Lil Wayne co-signed the 13-year-old driller Lil Mouse.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

It is sonically similar to the trap music subgenre and lyrically similar to the gangsta rap subgenre.[2] Early drill artists are noted for their explicit, confrontational style of lyricism and association with crime in Chicago, especially the Black Disciples and Gangster Disciples.[3][4][5][6] The genre progressed into the American mainstream in 2012 following the success of pioneering rappers like Chief Keef, Lil Durk, Lil Reese, Fredo Santana, G Herbo, Lil Bibby[7][8] and King Louie, who had many local fans and a significant internet presence alongside producer Young Chop. Other rappers, such as Lil JoJo, FBG Duck, S.

After the initial momentum of the subgenre subsided, Chicago drill saw a resurgence in the mainstream during the late 2010s and early 2020s with trailblazing artists such as King Von, Polo G, Calboy and a revamped Lil Durk.[21][22][23][24][25][26] Elsewhere, regional subgenres of drill music have gained mainstream popularity.

West cited drill as an influence on his 2013 album Yeezus,[58] and Chief Keef and King Louie had vocals featured on the album.[59] New Jersey DJ Akademiks's commentary YouTube channel 'War in Chiraq' played a significant role in presenting the early Chicago drill scene to a wider audience. It had a quarter million subscribers and 94 million views in its first two years.[60] Akademiks is quoted saying \"I’ve done a lot to create narratives and help rappers themselves.\"[61] Videographer A Zae Production was of the leading videographers on the early drill scene.[62] Videographer ZackTV also played a significant role in the exposure of Chicago's early drill scene to a wider audience. The YouTube interviews he conducted includes coverage such as Chief Keef's first on-camera interview, along with interviews with artists such as L'A Capone and RondoNumbaNine. ZackTV's work also sparked a media niche of intimate on-scene video journalism of the Chicago gangland culture behind the drill music, which had not been done before at the time.[63][64][65] ZackTV was considered a mentor by other gangland reporters in that niche around the country.[66] Drill's subject matter strongly contrasts with that of earlier Chicago rappers such as Kid Sister, Lupe Fiasco, Psalm One, Rhymefest and The Cool Kids.[31] Older Chicago rappers have been mixed in their reaction to drill's popularity and violence. In a radio interview, rapper Lupe Fiasco said \"Chief Keef scares me. Not him specifically, but just the culture that he represents ... The murder rate in Chicago is skyrocketing, and you see who's doing it and perpetrating it—they all look like Chief Keef.\"[31] After Chief Keef threatened Fiasco on Twitter, Fiasco said he was considering quitting the music scene.[31] Rhymefest tweeted that drill is \"the theme music to murder.\"[67] Chief Keef's debut album, \"Finally Rich\", released on Interscope Records in late 2012, was subsequently described as a \"classic\" album in the genre.[68][69][70] Despite the warm critique, \"Finally Rich\" sold an underwhelming 50,000 units, which resulted in record labels subsequently losing interest in drill, deeming it a \"fad\".[14] While drill music of Chicago fizzled out of mainstream popularity, a new scene was emerging in the UK and by the late-2010s was gaining mainstream popularity, spreading across Europe, influencing the creation of drill scenes around the continent.[71] UK drill[72][73][74] is a subgenre of drill music and road rap that originated in the South London district of Brixton from 2012 onwards. Borrowing heavily from the style of Chicago drill music, UK drill artists often rap about violent and hedonistic criminal lifestyles.[75][72] Typically, those who create this style of music are affiliated with gangs or come from socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods where crime is a way of life for many.[72] UK drill music is closely related to road rap, a British style of gangsta rap that became popular in the years prior to the existence of drill.[73][74][76] Musically, UK drill often exhibits violent language and provocative lyrics.[75] UK drill music evolved its own distinct style of production compared to Chicago drill with UK drill group 67 often credited for shifting the sound away from the Chicago influences it seemed to heavily draw inspiration from in its early days and foundation and for forming a more homegrown sound,[77] with LD – a member of 67 – being named as the godfather of UK drill.[78][79] The mid-2010s saw the emergence of Chicago-influenced Brooklyn drill artists such as Bobby Shmurda and Rowdy Rebel, while the late 2010s saw the emergence of new prominent drill artists from Brooklyn such as Pop Smoke, Sheff G, Fivio Foreign, Sleepy Hallow and 22Gz.[80][81][82][83][84][85][86]"], "reference": "Chief Keef's single \"I Don't Like\" became a viral hit and led to a deal with Interscope Records.

{"user_input": "Quick history of R&B?", "reference_contexts": ["Contemporary R&B (or simply R&B) is a popular music genre, originating from African-American musicians in the 1980s that combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop, soul, funk, hip hop, and/or electronic music. The genre features a distinctive record production style and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use melisma, and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music, pop culture and pop music. According to Geoffrey Himes speaking in 1989, the progressive soul movement of the early 1970s \"expanded the musical and lyrical boundaries of [R&B] in ways that haven't been equaled since\". This movement was led by soul singer-songwriter/producers such as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder.[1] Norman Whitfield's productions at Motown, the record label of Gaye, were also pioneering for setting the soul vocals and simple hooks of earlier rhythm and blues records against strong backbeats, vocal harmonies, and orchestral sounds, all of which thickened the texture of the music. Gaye's own music on albums such as What's Going On (1971) incorporated jazz influences that led the genre into a looser musical direction.[2] The nearest precursor to contemporary R&B came at the end of the disco era in the late 1970s, when Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones added more electronic elements to the sound of the time, creating a smoother dancefloor-friendly style.[2] The first result was Off the Wall (1979), which—according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic—\"was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus\" and \"was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk\".[3] Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson's Control (1986) was \"important to the development of R&B for several reasons\", as she and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, \"crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.\"[4] Ripani wrote that \"the success of \"Control\" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development.\"[4] That same year, Teddy Riley began producing R&B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed \"new jack swing\" and was applied to artists such as Keith Sweat, Bobby Brown, Johnny Kemp, and Bell Biv DeVoe.[5][6] Using hip hop-inspired backing tracks, a new genre labeled \"hip hop soul\" was created by Mary J. Blige and producer Sean Combs.[8] Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album (1992) eventually sold over 45 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling soundtrack of all time.[9] Janet Jackson's self-titled fifth studio album Janet (1993), which came after her multimillion-dollar contract with Virgin Records, sold over 14 million copies worldwide.[10] Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey recorded several Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, including \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration between both acts, which became the longest-running No. 1 hit in Hot 100 history. Carey also released a remix of her 1995 single \"Fantasy\", with Ol' Dirty Bastard as a feature, a collaboration format that was unheard of at this point. Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995—Daydream. In the late 1990s, neo soul, which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and Maxwell. Hill and Missy Elliott further blurred the line between R&B and hip hop by recording both styles. Beginning in 1995, the Grammy Awards enacted the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, with II by Boyz II Men becoming the first recipient. The award was later received by TLC for CrazySexyCool in 1996, Tony Rich for Words in 1997, Erykah Badu for Baduizm in 1998 and Lauryn Hill for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1999. In 1994 the singer Aaliyah dropped her debut album and in 1996 she released her second album called \"One In A Million\" with different sounds and produced by Missy Elliot and Timbaland, unknown at that moment. At the end of 1999, Billboard magazine ranked Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson as the first and second most successful artists of the 1990s.[11] Simultaneously, in the second half of the 1990s, The Neptunes and Timbaland set influential precedence on contemporary R&B and hip hop music.[12] Writing in 2003, music critic Robert Christgau describes modern R&B as being \"about texture, mood, feel—vocal and instrumental and rhythmic, articulated as they're smooshed together\".[13] Following periods of fluctuating success, urban music attained commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&B and hip hop artists.[15] In 2001, Alicia Keys released \"Fallin'\" as her debut single, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Mainstream Top 40 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.

The mid-2000s came with the emergence of new R&B acts Ashanti, Keyshia Cole and Akon. Ashanti's eponymous debut album topped both US Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It earned her three Grammy nominations winning one for the Best Contemporary R&B Album. R&B newcomer Chris Brown released his self-titled album in 2005 which debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. His debut single \"Run It!\" peaked atop on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and the US Radio Songs. During this time also came the emergence of R&B songwriters.[23] Bryan-Michael Cox co-wrote Usher's \"Burn\" and \"Confessions Part II\"(2005), Mariah Carey's \"Shake It Off\" and \"Don't Forget About Us\" (2006), and Chris Brown's \"Say Goodbye\"(2006).[24] Keri Hilson would co-write songs Mary J.

The use of effects such as Auto-Tune and new computerized synths have given R&B a more futuristic feel while still attempting to incorporate many of the genre's common themes such as love and relationships. According to Christgau in 2017, \"almost all R&B goes for voice-plus-sound rather than voice-plus-song, with the sound ranging from precision track-and-hook to idiosyncratic atmospherics.\"[30] Early 2010s artists Usher and Chris Brown began embracing new electronic influences while still keeping R&B's original feel. Usher's \"OMG\"[31] and \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\",[32] and Chris Brown's \"Yeah 3x\"[33] are all EDM-oriented. Singers Miguel, John Legend and Jeremih are popular in mainstream hip hop for many collaborations with rappers such as Wale, Rick Ross and J. Cole. Today's R&B is far more diverse and incorporates more sonic elements than before, as it expands its appeal and commercial viability.[34] Trap music's influence maintained a strong presence on the music charts with R&B singer Beyoncé's songs \"Drunk in Love\", \"Flawless\" and \"7/11\", Bryson Tiller's debut studio album, Trapsoul and Mary J. Blige's \"Thick of It\".[35] Latin R&B is gaining ground since the wave of artists began mixing trap with that sound in the middle of this decade.[36] Spanish-language singles by Alex Rose, Rauw Alejandro and Paloma Mami, which borrow shrewdly from R&B, are captivating a global audience.[37] In Latin America, the genre became popular with Alex Rose's \"Toda\",[37] and Sech's \"Otro Trago\".[38] In the 2020s, R&B continued to diversify and blend with other genres, most notably alternative R&B, a subgenre characterized by its experimental production, introspective lyrics, and departure from traditional R&B structures. Artists such as SZA, Frank Ocean, and the Weeknd have been pivotal in bridging mainstream R&B with alternative styles, introducing ethereal soundscapes, electronic elements, and unconventional storytelling to a broader audience.[39] Streaming platforms and social media, particularly TikTok and Spotify, have amplified the reach of R&B music.

H.E.R)\" into global hits.[40]", "<3-hop>\n\nUK drill scene emerged in the mid-2010s and subsequently influenced some regional scenes around the world, including Brooklyn drill, which also gained mainstream popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s with artists like Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign.[27][28][29] The lyrics of drill tend to be adversarial and aggressive. The Guardian's Lucy Stehlik said, \"Nihilistic drill reflects real life where its squeaky-clean hip-hop counterparts have failed.\"[30] Drill lyrics strongly contrast with the subject matter of earlier Chicago rappers[31] and contemporary mainstream hip hop which at the time of drill's emergence tended to glorify and celebrate a rise to wealth.[32] Drill lyrics typically reflect life on the streets, and tend to be gritty, violent, realistic, and nihilistic. Drill rappers use a grim, deadpan delivery,[33] often filtered through Auto-Tune, influenced by the \"stoned, aimless warbling of Soulja Boy (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and Lil Wayne before him.\"[34] Atlanta-based rappers Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame were important influences on the drill scene.[35] Although it bears many similarities to trap music, the speed of a drill beat is generally slower, with a moderate tempo, having about 60 to 70 beats per minute.[36][37] Some producers work at double tempo, such as 120 to 140 beats per minute.[citation needed] Drillers tend to be young; many prominent musicians in the scene started getting attention while still in their teens.[38] One of the genre's most prominent musicians, Chief Keef, was 16 when he signed a multi-million dollar record contract with Interscope,[39] and in an extreme example, Lil Wayne co-signed the 13-year-old driller Lil Mouse.[40] Critics have noted drill rappers' lack of concern with metaphor or wordplay. Chief Keef said that his simplistic flow is a conscious stylistic choice: \"I know what I'm doing. I mastered it. And I don't even really use metaphors or punchlines. 'Cause I don't have to. But I could. ... I think that's doing too much. I'd rather just say what's going on right now. ... I don't really like metaphors or punchlines like that.\"[41] Whet Moser wrote that Keef's songs are \"lyrically, rhythmically, and emotionally diminished, which is why they sound so airless and claustrophobic ... It's not even fatalistic, because that would imply a self-consciousness, a moral consideration, that isn't there in the lyrics. It just is, over and over again.\"[42] A profile on the scene in The New York Times examined the genre's aggression: \"With rare exception this music is unmediated and raw and without bright spots, focused on anger and violence. The instinct is to call this tough, unforgiving and concrete-hard music joyless, but in truth it's exuberant in its darkness. Most of its practitioners are young and coming into their creative own against a backdrop of outrageous violence in Chicago, particularly among young people—dozens of teenagers have been killed in Chicago this year—and often related to gangs. (There's a long history of overlap between Chicago's gangs and Chicago's rap.) That their music is a symphony of ill-tempered threats shouldn't be a surprise.\"[32] Stehlik called drill production style the \"sonic cousin to skittish footwork, southern-fried hip-hop and the 808 trigger-finger of trap.\"[30] Young Chop is frequently identified by critics as the genre's most characteristic producer.[43][44][45] The sound of trap producer Lex Luger's music is a major influence on drill,[35][44][46] and Young Chop identified Shawty Redd, Drumma Boy, and Zaytoven as important precursors to drill.[45] Chicago drill is traditionally characterized by synth brass and bell melodic elements, use of the crash cymbal, and busy snare drum patterns.[47] UK drill production, which is commonly utilized in Brooklyn drill, is characterized by a faster BPM, 808s \"slides,\" and more syncopated drum rhythms—including the use of a sped-up tresillo rhythm in the hi hat patterns.[48] David Drake of Complex said drill is not defined by any particular production style, but \"is about the entirety of the culture: the lingo, the dances, the mentality, and the music, much of which originated in 'Dro City', a gang-defined territory of city blocks in the Woodlawn neighborhood.\"[49] In street slang, \"drill\" means to fight or retaliate, and \"can be used for anything from females getting dolled up to all out war in the streets.\"[50] Dro City rapper Pac Man, considered the stylistic originator and forefather of the subgenre, is credited as the first to apply the term to the local hip hop music.[49][50] Pac Man's 2010 track, \"It's a Drill,\" is the first instance of the term being connected to the genre.[51] Regarding drill rappers' use of early social media, musician Naledge stated that Drill rappers \"understood virality in a way that I believe goes unremarked in terms of their genius and their ability to use social media to garner large audiences\".[52] Rapper Drake described the drill scene as a major vehicle of the early 2010s rise of Chicago hip hop, and described the scene as a grassroots movement that had incubated in a closed, interlocking system: on the streets and through social media in a network of clubs and parties and amongst high schools.[35] Drill developed on the South Side of Chicago, in the midst of escalating violence and a homicide crisis. Mark Guarino wrote for Salon that the music grew during \"a shift from historic feuding between monolithic crime organizations controlling thousands of members each to intrapersonal squabbling and retaliatory conflicts among smaller hybrid groups whose control extends just a few blocks... The toughened reality of living in these neighborhoods is what shaped Drill music.\"[53] In the drill scene, rap conflict and gang conflict overlap, and many of the young rappers come from backgrounds with experience of violence.[32][54] The Independent's Sam Gould wrote that Chief Keef \"represents both a scary strain of current hip hop culture and a seriously alienated group within American society.\"[40] YouTube was a platform for many drill rappers to release their music videos on, and ultimately significantly contributed to the genre's popularity.[55] Chief Keef is considered the primary progenitor and popularizer of drill music, responsible for bringing it to the mainstream.[20] In 2011 and 2012, he recorded multiple", "<4-hop>\n\nDrill is a subgenre of hip-hop music that originated in Chicago in the early 2010s. It is sonically similar to the trap music subgenre and lyrically similar to the gangsta rap subgenre.[2] Early drill artists are noted for their explicit, confrontational style of lyricism and association with crime in Chicago, especially the Black Disciples and Gangster Disciples.[3][4][5][6] The genre progressed into the American mainstream in 2012 following the success of pioneering rappers like Chief Keef, Lil Durk, Lil Reese, Fredo Santana, G Herbo, Lil Bibby[7][8] and King Louie, who had many local fans and a significant internet presence alongside producer Young Chop. Other rappers, such as Lil JoJo, FBG Duck, S. Dot,[9] Edai, L'A Capone, RondoNumbaNine, SD and producer Leek-E-Leek also contributed to the early drill scene.[10][11][12][13][14][15] Chief Keef, in particular, is considered the primary progenitor and popularizer of drill music, responsible for bringing it to the mainstream.[16][17][18][19][20] The growing fanbase sparked major label interest, leading to deal negotiations and signings. After the initial momentum of the subgenre subsided, Chicago drill saw a resurgence in the mainstream during the late 2010s and early 2020s with trailblazing artists such as King Von, Polo G, Calboy and a revamped Lil Durk.[21][22][23][24][25][26] Elsewhere, regional subgenres of drill music have gained mainstream popularity. Tailing the Chicago drill scene, a", "<5-hop>\n\nsingles, including \"Love Sosa\", \"I Don't Like\" and \"Bang\", which became viral hits, and was subsequently offered a deal from Interscope Records.[56] Around the same time, King Louie, another drill rapper, was given a record deal from Epic Records.[14] By late 2012, rappers from other scenes and hip hop stars like Kanye West, Drake and Rick Ross were collaborating with drill musicians.[57] Kanye West remixed \"I Don't Like\" for the 2012 GOOD Music compilation Cruel Summer as \"Don't Like\", with features from West, Chief Keef, Pusha T, Big Sean and Jadakiss. West cited drill as an influence on his 2013 album Yeezus,[58] and Chief Keef and King Louie had vocals featured on the album.[59] New Jersey DJ Akademiks's commentary YouTube channel 'War in Chiraq' played a significant role in presenting the early Chicago drill scene to a wider audience. It had a quarter million subscribers and 94 million views in its first two years.[60] Akademiks is quoted saying \"I’ve done a lot to create narratives and help rappers themselves.\"[61] Videographer A Zae Production was of the leading videographers on the early drill scene.[62] Videographer ZackTV also played a significant role in the exposure of Chicago's early drill scene to a wider audience. The YouTube interviews he conducted includes coverage such as Chief Keef's first on-camera interview, along with interviews with artists such as L'A Capone and RondoNumbaNine. ZackTV's work also sparked a media niche of intimate on-scene video journalism of the Chicago gangland culture behind the drill music, which had not been done before at the time.[63][64][65] ZackTV was considered a mentor by other gangland reporters in that niche around the country.[66] Drill's subject matter strongly contrasts with that of earlier Chicago rappers such as Kid Sister, Lupe Fiasco, Psalm One, Rhymefest and The Cool Kids.[31] Older Chicago rappers have been mixed in their reaction to drill's popularity and violence. In a radio interview, rapper Lupe Fiasco said \"Chief Keef scares me. Not him specifically, but just the culture that he represents ... The murder rate in Chicago is skyrocketing, and you see who's doing it and perpetrating it—they all look like Chief Keef.\"[31] After Chief Keef threatened Fiasco on Twitter, Fiasco said he was considering quitting the music scene.[31] Rhymefest tweeted that drill is \"the theme music to murder.\"[67] Chief Keef's debut album, \"Finally Rich\", released on Interscope Records in late 2012, was subsequently described as a \"classic\" album in the genre.[68][69][70] Despite the warm critique, \"Finally Rich\" sold an underwhelming 50,000 units, which resulted in record labels subsequently losing interest in drill, deeming it a \"fad\".[14] While drill music of Chicago fizzled out of mainstream popularity, a new scene was emerging in the UK and by the late-2010s was gaining mainstream popularity, spreading across Europe, influencing the creation of drill scenes around the continent.[71] UK drill[72][73][74] is a subgenre of drill music and road rap that originated in the South London district of Brixton from 2012 onwards. Borrowing heavily from the style of Chicago drill music, UK drill artists often rap about violent and hedonistic criminal lifestyles.[75][72] Typically, those who create this style of music are affiliated with gangs or come from socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods where crime is a way of life for many.[72] UK drill music is closely related to road rap, a British style of gangsta rap that became popular in the years prior to the existence of drill.[73][74][76] Musically, UK drill often exhibits violent language and provocative lyrics.[75] UK drill music evolved its own distinct style of production compared to Chicago drill with UK drill group 67 often credited for shifting the sound away from the Chicago influences it seemed to heavily draw inspiration from in its early days and foundation and for forming a more homegrown sound,[77] with LD – a member of 67 – being named as the godfather of UK drill.[78][79] The mid-2010s saw the emergence of Chicago-influenced Brooklyn drill artists such as Bobby Shmurda and Rowdy Rebel, while the late 2010s saw the emergence of new prominent drill artists from Brooklyn such as Pop Smoke, Sheff G, Fivio Foreign, Sleepy Hallow and 22Gz.[80][81][82][83][84][85][86]", "<6-hop>\n\nLater Brooklyn drill production is heavily influenced by UK drill (the latter of which brings production influences from grime and UK garage)[87] with artists such as Fivio Foreign, Sheff G, Smoove'L, Bizzy Banks, 22Gz, and Pop Smoke collaborating with UK drill producers such as 808Melo, Yamaica Productions, Yoz Beats, Tommyprime and AXL Beats.[88][89][90] Pop Smoke's song \"Welcome to the Party\", produced by 808Melo was a prominent release in 2019 and saw remixes from Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill and British MC Skepta.[80][91][92][93][94] Sheff G's \"No Suburban\" (released in 2017) and 22Gz's \"Suburban\" (released in 2016) have been credited for bringing attention to later Brooklyn drill.[83] In 2022, some people, including New York City mayor Eric Adams,[95] connected the pro-gun content of the genre to real world gun violence on the streets of New York and other major cities, given the violence surrounding a number of drill artists who have been killed such as Tdott Woo,[96] Pop Smoke, Chii Wvttz,[97] and gun violence victim Nas Blixky.[98][99] A shooting by alleged attempted murderer C Blu, who is signed to Interscope Records, also gave rise to concerns, echoing the 1990s era gangsta rap controversy.[100] In response to the epidemic of death arising out of the diss elements in the scene, in early 2022 a number of prominent New York DJs and music influencers, including DJ Drewski at Hot 97, Joe Budden, Ebro Darden of \"Ebro in the Morning\" on Hot 97, D Teck, and Power 105.1's DJ Gabe P either vowed to stop playing gang/diss records or re-iterated their refusal to play such content.[101][102][103] In September 2022, the New York police department removed local drill artists from Rolling Loud festival, allegedly, due to concerns of public safety. The police chief was concerned that the rappers would incite violence.[104] The 2023 We TV drama series Kold x Windy revolves around two women, played by Sh’Kia Augustin and Nijah Brenea, trying to make it in the violent world of Chicago drill music.[105]"], "reference": "Drill music, a hip-hop subgenre originating in Chicago, is known for its nihilistic lyrics reflecting real life, where mainstream hip-hop has failed.

{"user_input": "How did trap music influence R&B, and how did UK Drill influence Brooklyn Drill?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nContemporary R&B (or simply R&B) is a popular music genre, originating from African-American musicians in the 1980s that combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop, soul, funk, hip hop, and/or electronic music. The genre features a distinctive record production style and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use melisma, and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music, pop culture and pop music. According to Geoffrey Himes speaking in 1989, the progressive soul movement of the early 1970s \"expanded the musical and lyrical boundaries of [R&B] in ways that haven't been equaled since\". This movement was led by soul singer-songwriter/producers such as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder.[1] Norman Whitfield's productions at Motown, the record label of Gaye, were also pioneering for setting the soul vocals and simple hooks of earlier rhythm and blues records against strong backbeats, vocal harmonies, and orchestral sounds, all of which thickened the texture of the music. Gaye's own music on albums such as What's Going On (1971) incorporated jazz influences that led the genre into a looser musical direction.[2] The nearest precursor to contemporary R&B came at the end of the disco era in the late 1970s, when Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones added more electronic elements to the sound of the time, creating a smoother dancefloor-friendly style.[2] The first result was Off the Wall (1979), which—according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic—\"was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus\" and \"was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk\".[3] Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson's Control (1986) was \"important to the development of R&B for several reasons\", as she and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, \"crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.\"[4] Ripani wrote that \"the success of \"Control\" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development.\"[4] That same year, Teddy Riley began producing R&B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed \"new jack swing\" and was applied to artists such as Keith Sweat, Bobby Brown, Johnny Kemp, and Bell Biv DeVoe.[5][6] Using hip hop-inspired backing tracks, a new genre labeled \"hip hop soul\" was created by Mary J. Blige and producer Sean Combs.[8] Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album (1992) eventually sold over 45 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling soundtrack of all time.[9] Janet Jackson's self-titled fifth studio album Janet (1993), which came after her multimillion-dollar contract with Virgin Records, sold over 14 million copies worldwide.[10] Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey recorded several Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, including \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration between both acts, which became the longest-running No. 1 hit in Hot 100 history. Carey also released a remix of her 1995 single \"Fantasy\", with Ol' Dirty Bastard as a feature, a collaboration format that was unheard of at this point. Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995—Daydream. In the late 1990s, neo soul, which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and Maxwell. Hill and Missy Elliott further blurred the line between R&B and hip hop by recording both styles. Beginning in 1995, the Grammy Awards enacted the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, with II by Boyz II Men becoming the first recipient. The award was later received by TLC for CrazySexyCool in 1996, Tony Rich for Words in 1997, Erykah Badu for Baduizm in 1998 and Lauryn Hill for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1999. In 1994 the singer Aaliyah dropped her debut album and in 1996 she released her second album called \"One In A Million\" with different sounds and produced by Missy Elliot and Timbaland, unknown at that moment. At the end of 1999, Billboard magazine ranked Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson as the first and second most successful artists of the 1990s.[11] Simultaneously, in the second half of the 1990s, The Neptunes and Timbaland set influential precedence on contemporary R&B and hip hop music.[12] Writing in 2003, music critic Robert Christgau describes modern R&B as being \"about texture, mood, feel—vocal and instrumental and rhythmic, articulated as they're smooshed together\".[13] Following periods of fluctuating success, urban music attained commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&B and hip hop artists.[15] In 2001, Alicia Keys released \"Fallin'\" as her debut single, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Mainstream Top 40 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. It won three Grammy Awards in 2002, including Song of the Year, Best R&B Song, and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. It was also nominated for Record of the Year.[17] Beyoncé's solo studio debut album Dangerously in Love (2003) has sold over 5 million copies in the United States and earned five Grammy Awards.[18][19] Usher's Confessions (2004) sold 1.1 million copies in its first week[20] and over 8 million copies in 2004, since then it has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, As of 2016,[update] has sold over 10 million copies in the US and over 20 million copies worldwide. Confessions had four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one singles—\"Yeah!\", \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\" and \"My Boo\".[21] It won three Grammy Awards in 2005, including Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best R&B", "<2-hop>\n\nPerformance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \"My Boo\" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!\"[22] In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&B hits that year.[15] Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&B charts were topped by Outkast's \"Hey Ya!\", Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", Terror Squad's \"Lean Back\" and Ciara's \"Goodies\".[15] Chris Molanphy of \"The Village Voice\" later remarked that \"by the early 2000s, urban music \"was\" pop music.\"[15] Between 2005 and 2009 Raymond, Knowles and Keys released albums—B'Day, Here I Stand, I Am... Sasha Fierce and The Element of Freedom. Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi (2005) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and earned ten Grammy Award nominations. The second single \"We Belong Together\" topped the Hot 100 charts for 14 weeks, and was later hailed \"song of the decade\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2006. The mid-2000s came with the emergence of new R&B acts Ashanti, Keyshia Cole and Akon. Ashanti's eponymous debut album topped both US Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It earned her three Grammy nominations winning one for the Best Contemporary R&B Album. R&B newcomer Chris Brown released his self-titled album in 2005 which debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. His debut single \"Run It!\" peaked atop on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and the US Radio Songs. During this time also came the emergence of R&B songwriters.[23] Bryan-Michael Cox co-wrote Usher's \"Burn\" and \"Confessions Part II\"(2005), Mariah Carey's \"Shake It Off\" and \"Don't Forget About Us\" (2006), and Chris Brown's \"Say Goodbye\"(2006).[24] Keri Hilson would co-write songs Mary J. Blige's \"Take Me as I Am\" (2006), Omarion's \"Ice Box\" (2006), and Ciara's \"Like a Boy\"(2006).[25] Rico Love co-wrote Usher's \"Throwback\" (2005), Keri Hilson's \"Energy\"(2008), Pleasure P's \"Boyfriend #2\"(2008).[26] The-Dream wrote Rihanna's \"Umbrella\"(2007), J. Holiday's \"Bed\" and Usher's \"Moving Mountains\" and \"Trading Places\"(2008).[27] Ne-Yo wrote Mario's \"Let Me Love You\", Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" and \"Unfaithful\", Beyoncé's \"Irreplaceable\"(2006) and \"Me & U\"(2006) by Cassie.[28] According to Billboard, the most commercially successful R&B acts of the decade were Usher, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo and Akon.[29] Continuing from the 1990s and 2000s, R&B, like many other genres, drew influences from the technical innovations of the time and began to incorporate more electronic and machine-made sounds and instruments, this evolving style called Electro-R&B slowly began dominating the genre. The use of effects such as Auto-Tune and new computerized synths have given R&B a more futuristic feel while still attempting to incorporate many of the genre's common themes such as love and relationships. According to Christgau in 2017, \"almost all R&B goes for voice-plus-sound rather than voice-plus-song, with the sound ranging from precision track-and-hook to idiosyncratic atmospherics.\"[30] Early 2010s artists Usher and Chris Brown began embracing new electronic influences while still keeping R&B's original feel. Usher's \"OMG\"[31] and \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\",[32] and Chris Brown's \"Yeah 3x\"[33] are all EDM-oriented. Singers Miguel, John Legend and Jeremih are popular in mainstream hip hop for many collaborations with rappers such as Wale, Rick Ross and J. Cole. Today's R&B is far more diverse and incorporates more sonic elements than before, as it expands its appeal and commercial viability.[34] Trap music's influence maintained a strong presence on the music charts with R&B singer Beyoncé's songs \"Drunk in Love\", \"Flawless\" and \"7/11\", Bryson Tiller's debut studio album, Trapsoul and Mary J. Blige's \"Thick of It\".[35] Latin R&B is gaining ground since the wave of artists began mixing trap with that sound in the middle of this decade.[36] Spanish-language singles by Alex Rose, Rauw Alejandro and Paloma Mami, which borrow shrewdly from R&B, are captivating a global audience.[37] In Latin America, the genre became popular with Alex Rose's \"Toda\",[37] and Sech's \"Otro Trago\".[38] In the 2020s, R&B continued to diversify and blend with other genres, most notably alternative R&B, a subgenre characterized by its experimental production, introspective lyrics, and departure from traditional R&B structures. Artists such as SZA, Frank Ocean, and the Weeknd have been pivotal in bridging mainstream R&B with alternative styles, introducing ethereal soundscapes, electronic elements, and unconventional storytelling to a broader audience.[39] Streaming platforms and social media, particularly TikTok and Spotify, have amplified the reach of R&B music. Viral moments have catapulted songs like SZA's \"Snooze\" and Daniel Caesar's \"Best Part (feat. H.E.R)\" into global hits.[40]", "<3-hop>\n\nUK drill scene emerged in the mid-2010s and subsequently influenced some regional scenes around the world, including Brooklyn drill, which also gained mainstream popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s with artists like Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign.[27][28][29] The lyrics of drill tend to be adversarial and aggressive.

The toughened reality of living in these neighborhoods is what shaped Drill music.\"[53] In the drill scene, rap conflict and gang conflict overlap, and many of the young rappers come from backgrounds with experience of violence.[32][54] The Independent's Sam Gould wrote that Chief Keef \"represents both a scary strain of current hip hop culture and a seriously alienated group within American society.\"[40] YouTube was a platform for many drill rappers to release their music videos on, and ultimately significantly contributed to the genre's popularity.[55] Chief Keef is considered the primary progenitor and popularizer of drill music, responsible for bringing it to the mainstream.[20] In 2011 and 2012, he recorded multiple", "<4-hop>\n\nsingles, including \"Love Sosa\", \"I Don't Like\" and \"Bang\", which became viral hits, and was subsequently offered a deal from Interscope Records.[56] Around the same time, King Louie, another drill rapper, was given a record deal from Epic Records.[14] By late 2012, rappers from other scenes and hip hop stars like Kanye West, Drake and Rick Ross were collaborating with drill musicians.[57] Kanye West remixed \"I Don't Like\" for the 2012 GOOD Music compilation Cruel Summer as \"Don't Like\", with features from West, Chief Keef, Pusha T, Big Sean and Jadakiss. West cited drill as an influence on his 2013 album Yeezus,[58] and Chief Keef and King Louie had vocals featured on the album.[59] New Jersey DJ Akademiks's commentary YouTube channel 'War in Chiraq' played a significant role in presenting the early Chicago drill scene to a wider audience. It had a quarter million subscribers and 94 million views in its first two years.[60] Akademiks is quoted saying \"I’ve done a lot to create narratives and help rappers themselves.\"[61] Videographer A Zae Production was of the leading videographers on the early drill scene.[62] Videographer ZackTV also played a significant role in the exposure of Chicago's early drill scene to a wider audience. The YouTube interviews he conducted includes coverage such as Chief Keef's first on-camera interview, along with interviews with artists such as L'A Capone and RondoNumbaNine. ZackTV's work also sparked a media niche of intimate on-scene video journalism of the Chicago gangland culture behind the drill music, which had not been done before at the time.[63][64][65] ZackTV was considered a mentor by other gangland reporters in that niche around the country.[66] Drill's subject matter strongly contrasts with that of earlier Chicago rappers such as Kid Sister, Lupe Fiasco, Psalm One, Rhymefest and The Cool Kids.[31] Older Chicago rappers have been mixed in their reaction to drill's popularity and violence. In a radio interview, rapper Lupe Fiasco said \"Chief Keef scares me. Not him specifically, but just the culture that he represents ... The murder rate in Chicago is skyrocketing, and you see who's doing it and perpetrating it—they all look like Chief Keef.\"[31] After Chief Keef threatened Fiasco on Twitter, Fiasco said he was considering quitting the music scene.[31] Rhymefest tweeted that drill is \"the theme music to murder.\"[67] Chief Keef's debut album, \"Finally Rich\", released on Interscope Records in late 2012, was subsequently described as a \"classic\" album in the genre.[68][69][70] Despite the warm critique, \"Finally Rich\" sold an underwhelming 50,000 units, which resulted in record labels subsequently losing interest in drill, deeming it a \"fad\".[14] While drill music of Chicago fizzled out of mainstream popularity, a new scene was emerging in the UK and by the late-2010s was gaining mainstream popularity, spreading across Europe, influencing the creation of drill scenes around the continent.[71] UK drill[72][73][74] is a subgenre of drill music and road rap that originated in the South London district of Brixton from 2012 onwards. Borrowing heavily from the style of Chicago drill music, UK drill artists often rap about violent and hedonistic criminal lifestyles.[75][72] Typically, those who create this style of music are affiliated with gangs or come from socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods where crime is a way of life for many.[72] UK drill music is closely related to road rap, a British style of gangsta rap that became popular in the years prior to the existence of drill.[73][74][76] Musically, UK drill often exhibits violent language and provocative lyrics.[75] UK drill music evolved its own distinct style of production compared to Chicago drill with UK drill group 67 often credited for shifting the sound away from the Chicago influences it seemed to heavily draw inspiration from in its early days and foundation and for forming a more homegrown sound,[77] with LD – a member of 67 – being named as the godfather of UK drill.[78][79] The mid-2010s saw the emergence of Chicago-influenced Brooklyn drill artists such as Bobby Shmurda and Rowdy Rebel, while the late 2010s saw the emergence of new prominent drill artists from Brooklyn such as Pop Smoke, Sheff G, Fivio Foreign, Sleepy Hallow and 22Gz.[80][81][82][83][84][85][86]", "<5-hop>\n\nLater Brooklyn drill production is heavily influenced by UK drill (the latter of which brings production influences from grime and UK garage)[87] with artists such as Fivio Foreign, Sheff G, Smoove'L, Bizzy Banks, 22Gz, and Pop Smoke collaborating with UK drill producers such as 808Melo, Yamaica Productions, Yoz Beats, Tommyprime and AXL Beats.[88][89][90] Pop Smoke's song \"Welcome to the Party\", produced by 808Melo was a prominent release in 2019 and saw remixes from Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill and British MC Skepta.[80][91][92][93][94] Sheff G's \"No Suburban\" (released in 2017) and 22Gz's \"Suburban\" (released in 2016) have been credited for bringing attention to later Brooklyn drill.[83] In 2022, some people, including New York City mayor Eric Adams,[95] connected the pro-gun content of the genre to real world gun violence on the streets of New York and other major cities, given the violence surrounding a number of drill artists who have been killed such as Tdott Woo,[96] Pop Smoke, Chii Wvttz,[97] and gun violence victim Nas Blixky.[98][99] A shooting by alleged attempted murderer C Blu, who is signed to Interscope Records, also gave rise to concerns, echoing the 1990s era gangsta rap controversy.[100] In response to the epidemic of death arising out of the diss elements in the scene, in early 2022 a number of prominent New York DJs and music influencers, including DJ Drewski at Hot 97, Joe Budden, Ebro Darden of \"Ebro in the Morning\" on Hot 97, D Teck, and Power 105.1's DJ Gabe P either vowed to stop playing gang/diss records or re-iterated their refusal to play such content.[101][102][103] In September 2022, the New York police department removed local drill artists from Rolling Loud festival, allegedly, due to concerns of public safety. The police chief was concerned that the rappers would incite violence.[104] The 2023 We TV drama series Kold x Windy revolves around two women, played by Sh’Kia Augustin and Nijah Brenea, trying to make it in the violent world of Chicago drill music.[105]"], "reference": "Trap music's influence maintained a strong presence on the R&B music charts, as seen in Beyoncé's songs.

{"user_input": "Considering the evolution of R&B from its roots in funk music and the influence of African-American artists like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, how did hip-hop subgenres like drill, particularly in Chicago, adopt nihilistic themes and reflect gang culture, and what role did social media play in the dissemination and popularization of this grittier, more violent style of music?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nContemporary R&B (or simply R&B) is a popular music genre, originating from African-American musicians in the 1980s that combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop, soul, funk, hip hop, and/or electronic music. The genre features a distinctive record production style and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use melisma, and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music, pop culture and pop music. According to Geoffrey Himes speaking in 1989, the progressive soul movement of the early 1970s \"expanded the musical and lyrical boundaries of [R&B] in ways that haven't been equaled since\". This movement was led by soul singer-songwriter/producers such as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder.[1] Norman Whitfield's productions at Motown, the record label of Gaye, were also pioneering for setting the soul vocals and simple hooks of earlier rhythm and blues records against strong backbeats, vocal harmonies, and orchestral sounds, all of which thickened the texture of the music. Gaye's own music on albums such as What's Going On (1971) incorporated jazz influences that led the genre into a looser musical direction.[2] The nearest precursor to contemporary R&B came at the end of the disco era in the late 1970s, when Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones added more electronic elements to the sound of the time, creating a smoother dancefloor-friendly style.[2] The first result was Off the Wall (1979), which—according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic—\"was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus\" and \"was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk\".[3] Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson's Control (1986) was \"important to the development of R&B for several reasons\", as she and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, \"crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.\"[4] Ripani wrote that \"the success of \"Control\" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development.\"[4] That same year, Teddy Riley began producing R&B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed \"new jack swing\" and was applied to artists such as Keith Sweat, Bobby Brown, Johnny Kemp, and Bell Biv DeVoe.[5][6] Using hip hop-inspired backing tracks, a new genre labeled \"hip hop soul\" was created by Mary J. Blige and producer Sean Combs.[8] Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album (1992) eventually sold over 45 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling soundtrack of all time.[9] Janet Jackson's self-titled fifth studio album Janet (1993), which came after her multimillion-dollar contract with Virgin Records, sold over 14 million copies worldwide.[10] Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey recorded several Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, including \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration between both acts, which became the longest-running No. 1 hit in Hot 100 history. Carey also released a remix of her 1995 single \"Fantasy\", with Ol' Dirty Bastard as a feature, a collaboration format that was unheard of at this point. Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995—Daydream. In the late 1990s, neo soul, which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and Maxwell. Hill and Missy Elliott further blurred the line between R&B and hip hop by recording both styles. Beginning in 1995, the Grammy Awards enacted the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, with II by Boyz II Men becoming the first recipient. The award was later received by TLC for CrazySexyCool in 1996, Tony Rich for Words in 1997, Erykah Badu for Baduizm in 1998 and Lauryn Hill for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1999. In 1994 the singer Aaliyah dropped her debut album and in 1996 she released her second album called \"One In A Million\" with different sounds and produced by Missy Elliot and Timbaland, unknown at that moment. At the end of 1999, Billboard magazine ranked Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson as the first and second most successful artists of the 1990s.[11] Simultaneously, in the second half of the 1990s, The Neptunes and Timbaland set influential precedence on contemporary R&B and hip hop music.[12] Writing in 2003, music critic Robert Christgau describes modern R&B as being \"about texture, mood, feel—vocal and instrumental and rhythmic, articulated as they're smooshed together\".[13] Following periods of fluctuating success, urban music attained commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&B and hip hop artists.[15] In 2001, Alicia Keys released \"Fallin'\" as her debut single, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Mainstream Top 40 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. It won three Grammy Awards in 2002, including Song of the Year, Best R&B Song, and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. It was also nominated for Record of the Year.[17] Beyoncé's solo studio debut album Dangerously in Love (2003) has sold over 5 million copies in the United States and earned five Grammy Awards.[18][19] Usher's Confessions (2004) sold 1.1 million copies in its first week[20] and over 8 million copies in 2004, since then it has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, As of 2016,[update] has sold over 10 million copies in the US and over 20 million copies worldwide. Confessions had four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one singles—\"Yeah!\", \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\" and \"My Boo\".[21] It won three Grammy Awards in 2005, including Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best R&B", "<2-hop>\n\nPerformance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \"My Boo\" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!\"[22] In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&B hits that year.[15] Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&B charts were topped by Outkast's \"Hey Ya!\", Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", Terror Squad's \"Lean Back\" and Ciara's \"Goodies\".[15] Chris Molanphy of \"The Village Voice\" later remarked that \"by the early 2000s, urban music \"was\" pop music.\"[15] Between 2005 and 2009 Raymond, Knowles and Keys released albums—B'Day, Here I Stand, I Am... Sasha Fierce and The Element of Freedom. Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi (2005) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and earned ten Grammy Award nominations. The second single \"We Belong Together\" topped the Hot 100 charts for 14 weeks, and was later hailed \"song of the decade\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2006. The mid-2000s came with the emergence of new R&B acts Ashanti, Keyshia Cole and Akon. Ashanti's eponymous debut album topped both US Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It earned her three Grammy nominations winning one for the Best Contemporary R&B Album. R&B newcomer Chris Brown released his self-titled album in 2005 which debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. His debut single \"Run It!\" peaked atop on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and the US Radio Songs. During this time also came the emergence of R&B songwriters.[23] Bryan-Michael Cox co-wrote Usher's \"Burn\" and \"Confessions Part II\"(2005), Mariah Carey's \"Shake It Off\" and \"Don't Forget About Us\" (2006), and Chris Brown's \"Say Goodbye\"(2006).[24] Keri Hilson would co-write songs Mary J. Blige's \"Take Me as I Am\" (2006), Omarion's \"Ice Box\" (2006), and Ciara's \"Like a Boy\"(2006).[25] Rico Love co-wrote Usher's \"Throwback\" (2005), Keri Hilson's \"Energy\"(2008), Pleasure P's \"Boyfriend #2\"(2008).[26] The-Dream wrote Rihanna's \"Umbrella\"(2007), J. Holiday's \"Bed\" and Usher's \"Moving Mountains\" and \"Trading Places\"(2008).[27] Ne-Yo wrote Mario's \"Let Me Love You\", Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" and \"Unfaithful\", Beyoncé's \"Irreplaceable\"(2006) and \"Me & U\"(2006) by Cassie.[28] According to Billboard, the most commercially successful R&B acts of the decade were Usher, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo and Akon.[29] Continuing from the 1990s and 2000s, R&B, like many other genres, drew influences from the technical innovations of the time and began to incorporate more electronic and machine-made sounds and instruments, this evolving style called Electro-R&B slowly began dominating the genre. The use of effects such as Auto-Tune and new computerized synths have given R&B a more futuristic feel while still attempting to incorporate many of the genre's common themes such as love and relationships. According to Christgau in 2017, \"almost all R&B goes for voice-plus-sound rather than voice-plus-song, with the sound ranging from precision track-and-hook to idiosyncratic atmospherics.\"[30] Early 2010s artists Usher and Chris Brown began embracing new electronic influences while still keeping R&B's original feel. Usher's \"OMG\"[31] and \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\",[32] and Chris Brown's \"Yeah 3x\"[33] are all EDM-oriented. Singers Miguel, John Legend and Jeremih are popular in mainstream hip hop for many collaborations with rappers such as Wale, Rick Ross and J. Cole. Today's R&B is far more diverse and incorporates more sonic elements than before, as it expands its appeal and commercial viability.[34] Trap music's influence maintained a strong presence on the music charts with R&B singer Beyoncé's songs \"Drunk in Love\", \"Flawless\" and \"7/11\", Bryson Tiller's debut studio album, Trapsoul and Mary J. Blige's \"Thick of It\".[35] Latin R&B is gaining ground since the wave of artists began mixing trap with that sound in the middle of this decade.[36] Spanish-language singles by Alex Rose, Rauw Alejandro and Paloma Mami, which borrow shrewdly from R&B, are captivating a global audience.[37] In Latin America, the genre became popular with Alex Rose's \"Toda\",[37] and Sech's \"Otro Trago\".[38] In the 2020s, R&B continued to diversify and blend with other genres, most notably alternative R&B, a subgenre characterized by its experimental production, introspective lyrics, and departure from traditional R&B structures. Artists such as SZA, Frank Ocean, and the Weeknd have been pivotal in bridging mainstream R&B with alternative styles, introducing ethereal soundscapes, electronic elements, and unconventional storytelling to a broader audience.[39] Streaming platforms and social media, particularly TikTok and Spotify, have amplified the reach of R&B music. Viral moments have catapulted songs like SZA's \"Snooze\" and Daniel Caesar's \"Best Part (feat. H.E.R)\" into global hits.[40]", "<3-hop>\n\nUK drill scene emerged in the mid-2010s and subsequently influenced some regional scenes around the world, including Brooklyn drill, which also gained mainstream popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s with artists like Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign.[27][28][29] The lyrics of drill tend to be adversarial and aggressive. The Guardian's Lucy Stehlik said, \"Nihilistic drill reflects real life where its squeaky-clean hip-hop counterparts have failed.\"[30] Drill lyrics strongly contrast with the subject matter of earlier Chicago rappers[31] and contemporary mainstream hip hop which at the time of drill's emergence tended to glorify and celebrate a rise to wealth.[32] Drill lyrics typically reflect life on the streets, and tend to be gritty, violent, realistic, and nihilistic. Drill rappers use a grim, deadpan delivery,[33] often filtered through Auto-Tune, influenced by the \"stoned, aimless warbling of Soulja Boy (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and Lil Wayne before him.\"[34] Atlanta-based rappers Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame were important influences on the drill scene.[35] Although it bears many similarities to trap music, the speed of a drill beat is generally slower, with a moderate tempo, having about 60 to 70 beats per minute.[36][37] Some producers work at double tempo, such as 120 to 140 beats per minute.[citation needed] Drillers tend to be young; many prominent musicians in the scene started getting attention while still in their teens.[38] One of the genre's most prominent musicians, Chief Keef, was 16 when he signed a multi-million dollar record contract with Interscope,[39] and in an extreme example, Lil Wayne co-signed the 13-year-old driller Lil Mouse.[40] Critics have noted drill rappers' lack of concern with metaphor or wordplay. Chief Keef said that his simplistic flow is a conscious stylistic choice: \"I know what I'm doing. I mastered it. And I don't even really use metaphors or punchlines. 'Cause I don't have to. But I could. ... I think that's doing too much. I'd rather just say what's going on right now. ... I don't really like metaphors or punchlines like that.\"[41] Whet Moser wrote that Keef's songs are \"lyrically, rhythmically, and emotionally diminished, which is why they sound so airless and claustrophobic ... It's not even fatalistic, because that would imply a self-consciousness, a moral consideration, that isn't there in the lyrics. It just is, over and over again.\"[42] A profile on the scene in The New York Times examined the genre's aggression: \"With rare exception this music is unmediated and raw and without bright spots, focused on anger and violence. The instinct is to call this tough, unforgiving and concrete-hard music joyless, but in truth it's exuberant in its darkness. Most of its practitioners are young and coming into their creative own against a backdrop of outrageous violence in Chicago, particularly among young people—dozens of teenagers have been killed in Chicago this year—and often related to gangs. (There's a long history of overlap between Chicago's gangs and Chicago's rap.) That their music is a symphony of ill-tempered threats shouldn't be a surprise.\"[32] Stehlik called drill production style the \"sonic cousin to skittish footwork, southern-fried hip-hop and the 808 trigger-finger of trap.\"[30] Young Chop is frequently identified by critics as the genre's most characteristic producer.[43][44][45] The sound of trap producer Lex Luger's music is a major influence on drill,[35][44][46] and Young Chop identified Shawty Redd, Drumma Boy, and Zaytoven as important precursors to drill.[45] Chicago drill is traditionally characterized by synth brass and bell melodic elements, use of the crash cymbal, and busy snare drum patterns.[47] UK drill production, which is commonly utilized in Brooklyn drill, is characterized by a faster BPM, 808s \"slides,\" and more syncopated drum rhythms—including the use of a sped-up tresillo rhythm in the hi hat patterns.[48] David Drake of Complex said drill is not defined by any particular production style, but \"is about the entirety of the culture: the lingo, the dances, the mentality, and the music, much of which originated in 'Dro City', a gang-defined territory of city blocks in the Woodlawn neighborhood.\"[49] In street slang, \"drill\" means to fight or retaliate, and \"can be used for anything from females getting dolled up to all out war in the streets.\"[50] Dro City rapper Pac Man, considered the stylistic originator and forefather of the subgenre, is credited as the first to apply the term to the local hip hop music.[49][50] Pac Man's 2010 track, \"It's a Drill,\" is the first instance of the term being connected to the genre.[51] Regarding drill rappers' use of early social media, musician Naledge stated that Drill rappers \"understood virality in a way that I believe goes unremarked in terms of their genius and their ability to use social media to garner large audiences\".[52] Rapper Drake described the drill scene as a major vehicle of the early 2010s rise of Chicago hip hop, and described the scene as a grassroots movement that had incubated in a closed, interlocking system: on the streets and through social media in a network of clubs and parties and amongst high schools.[35] Drill developed on the South Side of Chicago, in the midst of escalating violence and a homicide crisis.

Other rappers, such as Lil JoJo, FBG Duck, S. Dot,[9] Edai, L'A Capone, RondoNumbaNine, SD and producer Leek-E-Leek also contributed to the early drill scene.[10][11][12][13][14][15] Chief Keef, in particular, is considered the primary progenitor and popularizer of drill music, responsible for bringing it to the mainstream.[16][17][18][19][20] The growing fanbase sparked major label interest, leading to deal negotiations and signings. After the initial momentum of the subgenre subsided, Chicago drill saw a resurgence in the mainstream during the late 2010s and early 2020s with trailblazing artists such as King Von, Polo G, Calboy and a revamped Lil Durk.[21][22][23][24][25][26] Elsewhere, regional subgenres of drill music have gained mainstream popularity.

The murder rate in Chicago is skyrocketing, and you see who's doing it and perpetrating it—they all look like Chief Keef.\"[31] After Chief Keef threatened Fiasco on Twitter, Fiasco said he was considering quitting the music scene.[31] Rhymefest tweeted that drill is \"the theme music to murder.\"[67] Chief Keef's debut album, \"Finally Rich\", released on Interscope Records in late 2012, was subsequently described as a \"classic\" album in the genre.[68][69][70] Despite the warm critique, \"Finally Rich\" sold an underwhelming 50,000 units, which resulted in record labels subsequently losing interest in drill, deeming it a \"fad\".[14] While drill music of Chicago fizzled out of mainstream popularity, a new scene was emerging in the UK and by the late-2010s was gaining mainstream popularity, spreading across Europe, influencing the creation of drill scenes around the continent.[71] UK drill[72][73][74] is a subgenre of drill music and road rap that originated in the South London district of Brixton from 2012 onwards.

{"user_input": "Considering the evolution of R&B and its incorporation of hip hop elements, how did trap music influence contemporary R&B, and how did the UK Drill scene, with its origins and characteristics, further impact regional scenes like Brooklyn drill, particularly in the context of lyrical content and production styles?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nContemporary R&B (or simply R&B) is a popular music genre, originating from African-American musicians in the 1980s that combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop, soul, funk, hip hop, and/or electronic music. The genre features a distinctive record production style and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use melisma, and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music, pop culture and pop music. According to Geoffrey Himes speaking in 1989, the progressive soul movement of the early 1970s \"expanded the musical and lyrical boundaries of [R&B] in ways that haven't been equaled since\". This movement was led by soul singer-songwriter/producers such as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder.[1] Norman Whitfield's productions at Motown, the record label of Gaye, were also pioneering for setting the soul vocals and simple hooks of earlier rhythm and blues records against strong backbeats, vocal harmonies, and orchestral sounds, all of which thickened the texture of the music. Gaye's own music on albums such as What's Going On (1971) incorporated jazz influences that led the genre into a looser musical direction.[2] The nearest precursor to contemporary R&B came at the end of the disco era in the late 1970s, when Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones added more electronic elements to the sound of the time, creating a smoother dancefloor-friendly style.[2] The first result was Off the Wall (1979), which—according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic—\"was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus\" and \"was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk\".[3] Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson's Control (1986) was \"important to the development of R&B for several reasons\", as she and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, \"crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.\"[4] Ripani wrote that \"the success of \"Control\" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development.\"[4] That same year, Teddy Riley began producing R&B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed \"new jack swing\" and was applied to artists such as Keith Sweat, Bobby Brown, Johnny Kemp, and Bell Biv DeVoe.[5][6] Using hip hop-inspired backing tracks, a new genre labeled \"hip hop soul\" was created by Mary J. Blige and producer Sean Combs.[8] Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album (1992) eventually sold over 45 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling soundtrack of all time.[9] Janet Jackson's self-titled fifth studio album Janet (1993), which came after her multimillion-dollar contract with Virgin Records, sold over 14 million copies worldwide.[10] Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey recorded several Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, including \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration between both acts, which became the longest-running No. 1 hit in Hot 100 history. Carey also released a remix of her 1995 single \"Fantasy\", with Ol' Dirty Bastard as a feature, a collaboration format that was unheard of at this point. Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995—Daydream. In the late 1990s, neo soul, which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and Maxwell. Hill and Missy Elliott further blurred the line between R&B and hip hop by recording both styles. Beginning in 1995, the Grammy Awards enacted the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, with II by Boyz II Men becoming the first recipient. The award was later received by TLC for CrazySexyCool in 1996, Tony Rich for Words in 1997, Erykah Badu for Baduizm in 1998 and Lauryn Hill for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1999. In 1994 the singer Aaliyah dropped her debut album and in 1996 she released her second album called \"One In A Million\" with different sounds and produced by Missy Elliot and Timbaland, unknown at that moment. At the end of 1999, Billboard magazine ranked Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson as the first and second most successful artists of the 1990s.[11] Simultaneously, in the second half of the 1990s, The Neptunes and Timbaland set influential precedence on contemporary R&B and hip hop music.[12] Writing in 2003, music critic Robert Christgau describes modern R&B as being \"about texture, mood, feel—vocal and instrumental and rhythmic, articulated as they're smooshed together\".[13] Following periods of fluctuating success, urban music attained commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&B and hip hop artists.[15] In 2001, Alicia Keys released \"Fallin'\" as her debut single, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Mainstream Top 40 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. It won three Grammy Awards in 2002, including Song of the Year, Best R&B Song, and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. It was also nominated for Record of the Year.[17] Beyoncé's solo studio debut album Dangerously in Love (2003) has sold over 5 million copies in the United States and earned five Grammy Awards.[18][19] Usher's Confessions (2004) sold 1.1 million copies in its first week[20] and over 8 million copies in 2004, since then it has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, As of 2016,[update] has sold over 10 million copies in the US and over 20 million copies worldwide. Confessions had four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one singles—\"Yeah!\", \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\" and \"My Boo\".[21] It won three Grammy Awards in 2005, including Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best R&B", "<2-hop>\n\nPerformance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \"My Boo\" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!\"[22] In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&B hits that year.[15] Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&B charts were topped by Outkast's \"Hey Ya!\", Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", Terror Squad's \"Lean Back\" and Ciara's \"Goodies\".[15] Chris Molanphy of \"The Village Voice\" later remarked that \"by the early 2000s, urban music \"was\" pop music.\"[15] Between 2005 and 2009 Raymond, Knowles and Keys released albums—B'Day, Here I Stand, I Am... Sasha Fierce and The Element of Freedom. Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi (2005) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and earned ten Grammy Award nominations. The second single \"We Belong Together\" topped the Hot 100 charts for 14 weeks, and was later hailed \"song of the decade\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2006. The mid-2000s came with the emergence of new R&B acts Ashanti, Keyshia Cole and Akon. Ashanti's eponymous debut album topped both US Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It earned her three Grammy nominations winning one for the Best Contemporary R&B Album. R&B newcomer Chris Brown released his self-titled album in 2005 which debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. His debut single \"Run It!\" peaked atop on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and the US Radio Songs. During this time also came the emergence of R&B songwriters.[23] Bryan-Michael Cox co-wrote Usher's \"Burn\" and \"Confessions Part II\"(2005), Mariah Carey's \"Shake It Off\" and \"Don't Forget About Us\" (2006), and Chris Brown's \"Say Goodbye\"(2006).[24] Keri Hilson would co-write songs Mary J. Blige's \"Take Me as I Am\" (2006), Omarion's \"Ice Box\" (2006), and Ciara's \"Like a Boy\"(2006).[25] Rico Love co-wrote Usher's \"Throwback\" (2005), Keri Hilson's \"Energy\"(2008), Pleasure P's \"Boyfriend #2\"(2008).[26] The-Dream wrote Rihanna's \"Umbrella\"(2007), J. Holiday's \"Bed\" and Usher's \"Moving Mountains\" and \"Trading Places\"(2008).[27] Ne-Yo wrote Mario's \"Let Me Love You\", Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" and \"Unfaithful\", Beyoncé's \"Irreplaceable\"(2006) and \"Me & U\"(2006) by Cassie.[28] According to Billboard, the most commercially successful R&B acts of the decade were Usher, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo and Akon.[29] Continuing from the 1990s and 2000s, R&B, like many other genres, drew influences from the technical innovations of the time and began to incorporate more electronic and machine-made sounds and instruments, this evolving style called Electro-R&B slowly began dominating the genre. The use of effects such as Auto-Tune and new computerized synths have given R&B a more futuristic feel while still attempting to incorporate many of the genre's common themes such as love and relationships. According to Christgau in 2017, \"almost all R&B goes for voice-plus-sound rather than voice-plus-song, with the sound ranging from precision track-and-hook to idiosyncratic atmospherics.\"[30] Early 2010s artists Usher and Chris Brown began embracing new electronic influences while still keeping R&B's original feel. Usher's \"OMG\"[31] and \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\",[32] and Chris Brown's \"Yeah 3x\"[33] are all EDM-oriented. Singers Miguel, John Legend and Jeremih are popular in mainstream hip hop for many collaborations with rappers such as Wale, Rick Ross and J. Cole. Today's R&B is far more diverse and incorporates more sonic elements than before, as it expands its appeal and commercial viability.[34] Trap music's influence maintained a strong presence on the music charts with R&B singer Beyoncé's songs \"Drunk in Love\", \"Flawless\" and \"7/11\", Bryson Tiller's debut studio album, Trapsoul and Mary J. Blige's \"Thick of It\".[35] Latin R&B is gaining ground since the wave of artists began mixing trap with that sound in the middle of this decade.[36] Spanish-language singles by Alex Rose, Rauw Alejandro and Paloma Mami, which borrow shrewdly from R&B, are captivating a global audience.[37] In Latin America, the genre became popular with Alex Rose's \"Toda\",[37] and Sech's \"Otro Trago\".[38] In the 2020s, R&B continued to diversify and blend with other genres, most notably alternative R&B, a subgenre characterized by its experimental production, introspective lyrics, and departure from traditional R&B structures. Artists such as SZA, Frank Ocean, and the Weeknd have been pivotal in bridging mainstream R&B with alternative styles, introducing ethereal soundscapes, electronic elements, and unconventional storytelling to a broader audience.[39] Streaming platforms and social media, particularly TikTok and Spotify, have amplified the reach of R&B music. Viral moments have catapulted songs like SZA's \"Snooze\" and Daniel Caesar's \"Best Part (feat. H.E.R)\" into global hits.[40]", "<3-hop>\n\nUK drill scene emerged in the mid-2010s and subsequently influenced some regional scenes around the world, including Brooklyn drill, which also gained mainstream popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s with artists like Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign.[27][28][29] The lyrics of drill tend to be adversarial and aggressive. The Guardian's Lucy Stehlik said, \"Nihilistic drill reflects real life where its squeaky-clean hip-hop counterparts have failed.\"[30] Drill lyrics strongly contrast with the subject matter of earlier Chicago rappers[31] and contemporary mainstream hip hop which at the time of drill's emergence tended to glorify and celebrate a rise to wealth.[32] Drill lyrics typically reflect life on the streets, and tend to be gritty, violent, realistic, and nihilistic. Drill rappers use a grim, deadpan delivery,[33] often filtered through Auto-Tune, influenced by the \"stoned, aimless warbling of Soulja Boy (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and Lil Wayne before him.\"[34] Atlanta-based rappers Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame were important influences on the drill scene.[35] Although it bears many similarities to trap music, the speed of a drill beat is generally slower, with a moderate tempo, having about 60 to 70 beats per minute.[36][37] Some producers work at double tempo, such as 120 to 140 beats per minute.[citation needed] Drillers tend to be young; many prominent musicians in the scene started getting attention while still in their teens.[38] One of the genre's most prominent musicians, Chief Keef, was 16 when he signed a multi-million dollar record contract with Interscope,[39] and in an extreme example, Lil Wayne co-signed the 13-year-old driller Lil Mouse.[40] Critics have noted drill rappers' lack of concern with metaphor or wordplay. Chief Keef said that his simplistic flow is a conscious stylistic choice: \"I know what I'm doing. I mastered it. And I don't even really use metaphors or punchlines. 'Cause I don't have to. But I could. ... I think that's doing too much. I'd rather just say what's going on right now. ... I don't really like metaphors or punchlines like that.\"[41] Whet Moser wrote that Keef's songs are \"lyrically, rhythmically, and emotionally diminished, which is why they sound so airless and claustrophobic ... It's not even fatalistic, because that would imply a self-consciousness, a moral consideration, that isn't there in the lyrics. It just is, over and over again.\"[42] A profile on the scene in The New York Times examined the genre's aggression: \"With rare exception this music is unmediated and raw and without bright spots, focused on anger and violence. The instinct is to call this tough, unforgiving and concrete-hard music joyless, but in truth it's exuberant in its darkness. Most of its practitioners are young and coming into their creative own against a backdrop of outrageous violence in Chicago, particularly among young people—dozens of teenagers have been killed in Chicago this year—and often related to gangs. (There's a long history of overlap between Chicago's gangs and Chicago's rap.) That their music is a symphony of ill-tempered threats shouldn't be a surprise.\"[32] Stehlik called drill production style the \"sonic cousin to skittish footwork, southern-fried hip-hop and the 808 trigger-finger of trap.\"[30] Young Chop is frequently identified by critics as the genre's most characteristic producer.[43][44][45] The sound of trap producer Lex Luger's music is a major influence on drill,[35][44][46] and Young Chop identified Shawty Redd, Drumma Boy, and Zaytoven as important precursors to drill.[45] Chicago drill is traditionally characterized by synth brass and bell melodic elements, use of the crash cymbal, and busy snare drum patterns.[47] UK drill production, which is commonly utilized in Brooklyn drill, is characterized by a faster BPM, 808s \"slides,\" and more syncopated drum rhythms—including the use of a sped-up tresillo rhythm in the hi hat patterns.[48] David Drake of Complex said drill is not defined by any particular production style, but \"is about the entirety of the culture: the lingo, the dances, the mentality, and the music, much of which originated in 'Dro City', a gang-defined territory of city blocks in the Woodlawn neighborhood.\"[49] In street slang, \"drill\" means to fight or retaliate, and \"can be used for anything from females getting dolled up to all out war in the streets.\"[50] Dro City rapper Pac Man, considered the stylistic originator and forefather of the subgenre, is credited as the first to apply the term to the local hip hop music.[49][50] Pac Man's 2010 track, \"It's a Drill,\" is the first instance of the term being connected to the genre.[51] Regarding drill rappers' use of early social media, musician Naledge stated that Drill rappers \"understood virality in a way that I believe goes unremarked in terms of their genius and their ability to use social media to garner large audiences\".[52] Rapper Drake described the drill scene as a major vehicle of the early 2010s rise of Chicago hip hop, and described the scene as a grassroots movement that had incubated in a closed, interlocking system: on the streets and through social media in a network of clubs and parties and amongst high schools.[35] Drill developed on the South Side of Chicago, in the midst of escalating violence and a homicide crisis. Mark Guarino wrote for Salon that the music grew during \"a shift from historic feuding between monolithic crime organizations controlling thousands of members each to intrapersonal squabbling and retaliatory conflicts among smaller hybrid groups whose control extends just a few blocks... The toughened reality of living in these neighborhoods is what shaped Drill music.\"[53] In the drill scene, rap conflict and gang conflict overlap, and many of the young rappers come from backgrounds with experience of violence.[32][54] The Independent's Sam Gould wrote that Chief Keef \"represents both a scary strain of current hip hop culture and a seriously alienated group within American society.\"[40] YouTube was a platform for many drill rappers to release their music videos on, and ultimately significantly contributed to the genre's popularity.[55] Chief Keef is considered the primary progenitor and popularizer of drill music, responsible for bringing it to the mainstream.[20] In 2011 and 2012, he recorded multiple", "<4-hop>\n\nsingles, including \"Love Sosa\", \"I Don't Like\" and \"Bang\", which became viral hits, and was subsequently offered a deal from Interscope Records.[56] Around the same time, King Louie, another drill rapper, was given a record deal from Epic Records.[14] By late 2012, rappers from other scenes and hip hop stars like Kanye West, Drake and Rick Ross were collaborating with drill musicians.[57] Kanye West remixed \"I Don't Like\" for the 2012 GOOD Music compilation Cruel Summer as \"Don't Like\", with features from West, Chief Keef, Pusha T, Big Sean and Jadakiss. West cited drill as an influence on his 2013 album Yeezus,[58] and Chief Keef and King Louie had vocals featured on the album.[59] New Jersey DJ Akademiks's commentary YouTube channel 'War in Chiraq' played a significant role in presenting the early Chicago drill scene to a wider audience. It had a quarter million subscribers and 94 million views in its first two years.[60] Akademiks is quoted saying \"I’ve done a lot to create narratives and help rappers themselves.\"[61] Videographer A Zae Production was of the leading videographers on the early drill scene.[62] Videographer ZackTV also played a significant role in the exposure of Chicago's early drill scene to a wider audience. The YouTube interviews he conducted includes coverage such as Chief Keef's first on-camera interview, along with interviews with artists such as L'A Capone and RondoNumbaNine. ZackTV's work also sparked a media niche of intimate on-scene video journalism of the Chicago gangland culture behind the drill music, which had not been done before at the time.[63][64][65] ZackTV was considered a mentor by other gangland reporters in that niche around the country.[66] Drill's subject matter strongly contrasts with that of earlier Chicago rappers such as Kid Sister, Lupe Fiasco, Psalm One, Rhymefest and The Cool Kids.[31] Older Chicago rappers have been mixed in their reaction to drill's popularity and violence.
