AllMusic defines it as comprising \"hip-hop groups that refuse to conform to any of the traditional stereotypes of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from funk and pop/rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, and even folk.\"[3] Alternative hip-hop developed in the late 1980s and experienced a degree of mainstream recognition during the early to mid-1990s. While some groups such as Arrested Development and the Fugees achieved commercial success, many alternative rap acts tend to be embraced by alternative rock listeners rather than hip-hop or pop audiences.[3] The commercial and cultural momentum was impeded by the simultaneous emergence of significantly harder-edged West Coast gangsta rap. A resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s at the dawn of the digital era with a rejuvenated interest in independent music by the general public. During the 2000s, alternative hip-hop reattained its place within the mainstream due to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the crossover success of artists such as Outkast and Kanye West. The alternative hip-hop movement has expanded beyond the United States to include the Somali-Canadian poet K'naan and the British artist M.I.A. Alternative hip-hop acts have attained much critical acclaim, but receive relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets. The most prominent alternative hip-hop acts include A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Hieroglyphics, the Pharcyde, Digable Planets, Death Grips and Black Sheep.[2] During the 2010s, the development of alternative hip hop music continued with artists taking a more \"experimental\" approach to hip hop music, marked by the appearance of internet era and streaming services, such as ASAP Rocky, Chief Keef, Yung Lean, Post Malone, Lil Yachty, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, XXXTentacion, Ski Mask the Slump God, Lil Peep, Trippie Redd, Juice Wrld, and Lil Skies. Playboi Carti's 2020 album Whole Lotta Redd, for example, is marked by this approach.[4] Originating in the late 1980s, in midst of the golden age of hip-hop, alternative hip-hop was headed primarily by East Coast groups such as De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Brand Nubian, and Digable Planets in subsidiary conjunction by West Coast acts such as the Pharcyde, Digital Underground, Souls of Mischief, Del the Funky Homosapien, and Freestyle Fellowship as well as certain Southern acts such as Arrested Development, Goodie Mob, and Outkast.[5] Similar to the alternative rock movement, alternative hip-hop segued into the mainstream at the dawn of the 1990s. Arrested Development, along with the Fugees, stand as some of the first few alternative rap to be recognized by mainstream audiences.[3] The classic debut albums 3 Feet High and Rising (1989),[6] People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990), and Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde (1992) achieved minor commercial success as they garnered immense acclaim from music critics, who described the records as ambitiously innovative but playful masterpieces, hailing the artists as the future of hip-hop music as a whole.[7] Contrary to alternative rock, which went on to become a mainstay in mainstream music and replaced the glam metal of the previous generation as the most popular form of rock music, alternative hip-hop's commercial momentum was impeded by the then also newly emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast gangsta rap.[7] With its aggressive tone, nihilistic tendencies, and violent imagery, gangsta rap was considered to be the more entertaining, more lucrative subgenre as signified by the high chart placings, radio success and multiplatinum-selling records of gangsta rappers such as Snoop Dogg, Warren G and N.W.A, who were widely embraced by major record labels and produced a legion of imitators.[7] Albums such as Straight Outta Compton (1989), The Chronic (1992) and Doggystyle (1993) redefined the direction of hip-hop, which resulted in lyricism concerning the gangsta lifestyle becoming the driving force of sales figures.[8] The situation changed around the mid-'90s with the emergence and mainstream popularity of East Coast hardcore rap artists such as Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, the Notorious B.I.G., and Mobb Deep. Following this development, many alternative rap acts eventually either disbanded or faded into obscurity.[9][10] In his 1995 book on the current state of hip-hop culture, music critic Stephen Rodrick wrote that, at that time, alternative hip-hop had \"drawn little more than barely concealed yawns from other rappers and urban audiences\" and concluded that the subgenre was a failure.[11] A commercial breakthrough came about in the late 1990s with the rejuvenated interest in indie music by the general public due to the mainstream success of acts like the Fugees and Arrested Development,[12] while acts such as Slum Village, Common,[13] and the Roots were rising to prominence.[10] The Fugees saw huge critical and commercial success with the release of their second album, The Score, in 1996.[14] The album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart,[15] and briefly became the best-selling hip-hop album of all time.[16] That same year, A Tribe Called Quest reached their commercial peak with the release of their album Beats, Rhymes and Life, which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and became their best-selling release,[17] while acts such as Outkast and De La Soul released some of their most definitive albums with Atliens and Stakes Is High.[18] Since the mid-1990s, independent record labels such as Rawkus Records, Rhymesayers Entertainment, Anticon, Stones Throw, Definitive Jux and QN5 have experienced lesser mainstream success with alternative rap acts such as CunninLynguists, Jurassic 5, Little Brother, Talib Kweli, MF Doom, Atmosphere, Antipop Consortium, Mos Def, Doomtree, Pharoahe Monch, El-P, Quasimoto, Living Legends, Cyne, Blue Scholars, and Aesop Rock. In the 2000s, alternative hip-hop reattained its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the crossover success of artists such as Outkast, Kanye West, and Gnarls Barkley.[19][20] Outkast's fifth"], "reference": "The alternative hip-hop movement has expanded beyond the United States to include the Somali-Canadian poet K'naan and the British artist M.I.A.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

The album won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year—making it only the second hip-hop album to win the award (The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill being the first) and has been certified diamond by selling 11 times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[21] MF Doom had been on the come up in the underground scene after releasing his debut studio album, Operation: Doomsday (1999). He came back to the hip-hop scene after the dissolving of group KMD.[2] Later, he and Madlib's 2004 project Madvillainy was released in this time period as the duo Madvillain. This album was praised by music critics and inspired other artists, such as Aminé and Joey Badass.[22] Gnarls Barkley experienced a surprise hit with their debut single, \"Crazy\". Due to high download sales, it reached number one in the single charts in several countries, including the United Kingdom, where it became the best-selling single of 2006.[23] The song was named the best song of 2006 by both Rolling Stone and the Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll.[24][25] Rolling Stone later ranked \"Crazy\" as the number-one song of the decade. The song has been certified double platinum by RIAA.[26] The duo were the recipient of multiple accolades; at the 49th Grammy Awards, they won the awards for Best Urban/Alternative Performance and Best Alternative Music Album.[27] Industry observers view the 2007 sales competition between Kanye West's Graduation and 50 Cent's Curtis as a turning point for hip-hop. West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone. Ben Detrick of XXL credited the outcome of the sales competition with altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold, writing, \"If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop's changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales. 50 lost handily, and it was made clear that excellent song crafting trumped a street-life experience. Kanye led a wave of new artists—Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, Drake, Nicki Minaj—who lacked the interest or ability to create narratives about any past gunplay or drug-dealing.\"[28] Similarly, in a retrospective article, Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the album's sales competition with 50 Cent's Curtis as a historical moment in hip-hop, writing that it \"highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.\"[29] Several artists and groups acknowledge being directly influenced by their 1990s predecessors in addition to alternative rock groups while their music has been noted by critics as expressing eclectic sounds, life experiences and emotions rarely seen in mainstream hip-hop.[30] As traditional rock music continually becomes less synonymous with pop music, more left-of-center artists who are not fully embraced by hip-hop radio have increasingly found inclusion on alternative radio.[31] According to Nielsen SoundScan, contemporary hip-hop acts who increasingly receive domestic airplay on alt-radio include Run the Jewels, Childish Gambino, Logic, Brockhampton, L.I.F.T. and nothing, nowhere.[31] Regarding audiences, according to Jeff Regan, senior director of music programming for the Alt Nation channel on Sirius XM Radio, \"This generation has maybe never even gone to a record store or CD store where there was a hip-hop section and a rock section—it has all been in front of them on a screen.\"[31] Thus recording artists and groups traditionally perceived as rappers are included on his predominantly rock-oriented playlists. He said, \"Whether it's Lil Peep or Brockhampton or Post Malone, we have tried records from all those artists. ... We need some depth perception in the music we're presenting. Whether it's done on a laptop or on an amp and a guitar, I just want to find something new—that's what alternative is supposed to be.\"[31] While some groups achieved commercial success, most alternative rap acts tended to be embraced largely by alternative rock listeners and indie music fans rather than hip-hop or pop audiences.[3] Artists receive limited exposure through commercial radio and other media outlets and primarily rely on campus radio and various independent media channels.[3] Alternative hip-hop is the recipient of consistent critical acclaim but is generally shunned by American mainstream media and widely regarded as commercially unappealing.[7] New York radio personality and spoken word artist Imhotep Gary Byrd's single \"The Crown\" was rejected by American radio stations for being \"too Black and too positive.\"[32] However, the song was very well received and become a hit in Europe.[32] It reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the longest record ever to reach the top 10 in the history of the British Charts.[33] Over the years, multiple organizations representing African Americans such as the National Black Leadership Alliance and the National Congress of Black Women have released statements criticizing how urban radio stations refuse to play rap music that does not demean and degrade black women, shunning alternative hip-hop artists such as Arrested Development and Dead Prez.[34] Q-Tip, frontman of the highly influential alternative rap group A Tribe Called Quest, had his sophomore solo effort, Kamaal the Abstract, shelved for nearly a decade after his record label deemed the genre-bending album as sounding uncommercial.[35] Q-Tip said: I am really disappointed that Kamaal wasn't released. LA Reid didn't know what to do with it; then, three years later, they release Outkast. What Outkast is doing now, those are the kinds of sounds that are on Kamaal the Abstract. Maybe even a little more out. Kamaal was just me, guerrilla.[36] Similarly, BET refused to play \"Lovin' It\", the lead single of duo Little Brother's socio-politically charged concept album The Minstrel Show (2005), which provided a tongue-in-cheek critique of African-American pop culture, on the grounds that the group's music was \"too intelligent\" for their target audience.[37][38] The network was subsequently satirized by the animated"], "reference": "According to the text, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (2003) won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making it only the second hip-hop album to win the award (The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill being the first).

Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign (hi-NRG, Euro disco) and developed into a diverse genre.[2] The genre employs electronic drums, drum machines, synthesizers, and occasionally vocoders. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish. The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982.[3] Italo disco faded in the early 1990s, then split into many genres (Eurobeat, Italo house, Italo dance). The term \"Italo\", a generic prefix meaning Italian, had been used on pop music compilation albums in West Germany as early as 1978, such as Italo Top Hits on the K-Tel label and the first volume of Italo Super Hits on the Ariola label.[4] There is no documentation of where the term \"Italo-Disco\" first appeared, but its origins are generally traced to Italian and other European disco recordings released in the West German market. Examples include the phrase \"Original Italo-Disco\" on the sleeve of the West German edition of \"Girls on Me\" by Amin-Peck in 1982, and the 1983 compilation album The Best of Italo-Disco.[5] These records, along with the Italo Boot Mix megamix, were released by Bernhard Mikulski on his ZYX label, who was therefore credited with coining the term \"Italo disco\".[1][6] The Best of and Boot Mix compilations each became a 16-volume series that culminated in 1991. Both series primarily featured disco music of Italian origin, often licensed from independent Italian labels which had limited distribution outside Italy, as well as songs in a similar style by other European artists. The presenters of the Italian music show Discoring (produced by RAI) usually referred to Italo disco tracks as \"rock elettronico\" (electronic rock) or \"balli da discoteca\" (disco dance) before the term \"Italo disco\" came into existence. Italo disco originated in Europe in the late 1970s. After Disco Demolition Night in 1979, American interest in disco sharply declined, whereas in Europe the genre maintained mainstream popularity and survived into the 1980s. The adoption of synthesizers and other electronic instruments by disco artists led to electronic dance music, which spawned many subgenres such as hi-NRG in America and space disco in Europe. Italo disco's influences include Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, French musician Didier Marouani, Italo-French drummer Cerrone, and the San Francisco-based hi-NRG producer Patrick Cowley, who worked with singers as Sylvester and Paul Parker. In the late 1970s, Italo disco group D.D. Sound (La Bionda) released the song \"1, 2, 3, 4, Gimme Some More\".[7] In 1979, Jacques Fred Petrus and Mauro Malavasi created the soulful post-disco groups Change and B.B. & Q. Band.[8] In 1981, both groups gained US R&B and Dance hits with \"Paradise\" and \"On the Beat\" respectively. Italo disco often features electronic sounds, electronic drums, drum machines, catchy melodies, vocoders, overdubs, and heavily accented English lyrics. By 1983, Italo disco's instrumentation was predominantly electronic. Along with love, Italo disco themes deal with robots and space, sometimes combining all three in songs like \"Robot Is Systematic\" (1982) by Lectric Workers and \"Spacer Woman\" (1983) by Charlie. Then also new musical genres that had set aside the rock of the 1970s thanks to new groups, such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Spandau Ballet and great pop artists Michael Jackson and Madonna. The 1980s brought the electronics with real instruments, experimenting new sounds, in short, it was a decade of great change in modern music.[9] In 1983, there were frequent hit singles, and labels such as American Disco, Crash, Merak, Sensation and X-Energy appeared. The popular label Discomagic Records released more than thirty singles within the year. It was also the year that the term \"Italo disco\" became widely known outside Italy, with the release of the first volumes of The Best of Italo Disco compilation series on the West German record label ZYX. After 1983, Italo disco was also produced outside Italy. Although Italo disco was successful in mainland Europe during the 1980s, only a few singles reached the UK charts, such as Ryan Paris's \"Dolce Vita\", Laura Branigan's \"Self Control\", Baltimora's \"Tarzan Boy\", Spagna's \"Call Me\" and Sabrina's \"Boys\", all of which were top 5 hits. Italo disco maintained an influence in the UK's underground music scenes in the UK, and its impact can be heard in the music of several British electronic acts such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order.[1] Canada, particularly Quebec, produced several remarkable Italo disco acts, including Trans X (\"Living on Video\"), Lime (\"Angel Eyes\"), Rational Youth (\"City of Night\"), Pluton & the Humanoids (\"World Invaders\"), Purple Flash Orchestra (\"We Can Make It\"), and Tapps (\"Forbidden Lover\"). Those productions were called \"Canadian disco\" during 1980–1984 in Europe and hi-NRG disco in the U.S. In English-speaking countries, it was called Italo disco and hi-NRG. In Mexico the style is known just as \"disco\", having nothing to do with the 1970s genre.[citation needed] West German productions were sung in English and were characterized by an emphasis on melody, exaggerated production, and a more earnest approach to the themes of love; examples may be found in the works of: Modern Talking, Fancy, American-born singer and Fancy protégé Grant Miller, Bad Boys Blue, Joy, Silent Circle, the Twins, Lian Ross, C.

The two most famous Eurobeat labels are A-Beat-C Records and Time Records. One traditional Italo disco label, S.A.I.F.A.M., still produces Eurobeat music for Japan. Around 1989 in Italy, Italo disco evolved into Italo house when Italian Italo disco artists experimented with harder beats and the \"house\" sound. Space disco is a type of dance music using synthesizers and space-like sounds and themes.[citation needed][12] At least one modern history of \"space disco\" traces the genre's origins to science fiction themes (outer space, robots, and the future) in the titles, lyrics and cover artwork of dance music in the late 1970s.[13] Plausible associations are drawn between the popularity of Star Wars (released mid-1977), the subsequent surge of interest in science fiction themes in popular culture, and the release of a number of science fiction themed and \"futuristic\"-sounding (synthesizer and arpeggiator-infused) disco music worldwide.[13][14] The most commercially successful space disco tracks were \"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band\" (1977) by Meco, and \"Automatic Lover\" (1978) by Dee D. Jackson, with each song reaching the top ten in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom. Even in Italy the Space genre had some followers, including I Signori della Galassia who showed up with glam sci-fi inspired clothes and whose album Iceman is still highly sought after by collectors today.[15] Additional examples of space disco usually include the compositions \"Just Blue\" and \"Symphony\" (both 1978) of French band Space,[13] the same for the track Magic Fly; additional tracks by Dee D. Jackson during the 1970s and 1980s, and \"I Feel Space\"[14] by Lindstrøm. Labels producing this type of music include[14] New York City-based post-disco record label Emergency Records specialized in reissuing/selling records from Italy (e.g. Kano \"I'm Ready\"),[16] since the 1970s. Kano is noted for incorporating American musical elements (\"heavy funk\" influences, \"breakbeat\" rhythm, the use of vocoder) with electronic music while using rudimentary synthesizers,[9] constituting one of the earliest forms of Italo disco. This form of Americanized Italo disco, that also includes Klein + M.B.O.[9] (\"Dirty Talk\", \"Wonderful\", \"The M. B. O. Theme\"), re-entered the States and was known to be influential on the development of house music.[9] Doctor's Cat (\"Feel the Drive\"), likewise, was one of the earliest \"house music\" songs.[17] Record labels include"], "reference": "As Italo disco declined in Europe, Italian and West German producers adapted the sound to Japanese tastes, creating \"Eurobeat\".

While acoustic instruments are often present and vital, Americana also often uses a full electric band.\"[3] The origins of Americana music can be traced back to the early 20th century, when rural American musicians began incorporating elements of folk, blues, and country music into their songs.[4] Americana musicians often played acoustic instruments such as the guitar, banjo, fiddle, and upright bass, and their songs typically told stories about the struggles and hardships of everyday life.[5] The American folk music revival began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. The folk revival in New York City was rooted in the resurgent interest in square dancing and folk dancing there in the 1940s as espoused by instructors such as Margot Mayo, which gave musicians such as Pete Seeger popular exposure.[6][7][8] The folk revival more generally as a popular and commercial phenomenon begins with the career of The Weavers, formed in November 1948 by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman, and Ronnie Gilbert of People's Songs, of which Seeger had been president and Hays executive secretary. The Kingston Trio, a group originating on the West Coast, were directly inspired by the Weavers in their style and presentation and covered some of the Weavers' material, which was predominantly traditional. The Kingston Trio's popularity would be followed by that of Joan Baez, whose debut album Joan Baez reached the top ten in late 1960 and remained on the Billboard charts for over two years. It was not long before the folk-music category came to include less traditional material and more personal and poetic creations by individual performers, who called themselves \"singer-songwriters\". As a result of the financial success of high-profile commercial folk artists, record companies began to produce and distribute records by a new generation of folk revival and singer-songwriters Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Eric von Schmidt, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Dave Van Ronk, Judy Collins, Tom Rush, Fred Neil, Gordon Lightfoot, Billy Ed Wheeler, John Denver, John Stewart, Arlo Guthrie, Harry Chapin, and John Hartford, among others. Some of this wave had emerged from family singing and playing traditions, and some had not. These singers frequently prided themselves on performing traditional material in imitations of the style of the source singers whom they had discovered, frequently by listening to Harry Smith's celebrated LP compilation of forgotten or obscure commercial 78rpm \"race\" and \"hillbilly\" recordings of the 1920s and 30s, the Folkways Anthology of American Folk Music (1951). A number of the artists who had made these old recordings were still very much alive and had been \"rediscovered\" and brought to the 1963 and 64 Newport Folk Festivals. For example, traditionalist Clarence Ashley introduced folk revivalists to the music of friends of his who still actively played the older music, such as Doc Watson and The Stanley Brothers. In the 1950s and 1960s, folk revival music began to evolve and incorporate elements of rock and roll and other popular music styles. Artists such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds began blending traditional folk and country music with electric guitars and drums, creating a new sound that came to be known as folk rock.[4] On January 20, 1965, the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to record Bob Dylan's acoustic tune \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" for release as their debut single on Columbia. The full, electric rock band treatment that the Byrds and producer Terry Melcher had given the song effectively created the template for the musical subgenre of folk rock.[9][10] McGuinn's melodic, jangling 12-string Rickenbacker guitar playing—which was heavily compressed to produce an extremely bright and sustained tone—was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day. The single also featured another major characteristic of the band's sound: their clear harmony singing, which usually featured McGuinn and Clark in unison, with Crosby providing the high harmony.[11] Additionally, Richie Unterberger has stated that the song's abstract lyrics took rock and pop songwriting to new heights; never before had such intellectual and literary wordplay been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group.[12] Within three months \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" had become the first folk rock smash hit,[13] reaching number one on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[14][15] The single's success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, during which a number of Byrds-influenced acts had hits on the American and British charts.[12] The term \"folk rock\" was itself coined by the American music press to describe the band's sound in June 1965, at roughly the same time as \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" peaked at number 1 in the U.S.[16][17] The commercial success of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and their debut album of the same name, along with Dylan's own recordings with rock instrumentation—on the albums Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965), and Blonde on Blonde (1966)—encouraged other folk acts, such as Simon & Garfunkel, to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as Buffalo Springfield, to form. Dylan's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25, 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre. In the 1990s the term alternative country, paralleling alternative rock, began to be used to describe a diverse group of", "<2-hop>\n\nmusicians and singers operating outside the traditions and industry of mainstream country music. Many eschewed the increasingly polished production values and pop sensibilities of the Nashville-dominated industry for a more lo-fi sound, frequently infused with a strong punk and rock and roll aesthetic. Alternative country drew on traditional American country music, the music of working people, preserved and celebrated by practitioners such as Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, and The Carter Family, often cited as major influences.[18] Another major influence was country rock, the result of fusing country music with a rock & roll sound. The artist most commonly thought to have originated country rock is Gram Parsons (who referred to his sound as \"Cosmic American Music\"), although Michael Nesmith, Steve Earle[19] and Gene Clark are frequently identified as important innovators.[20] The third factor was punk rock, which supplied an energy and DIY attitude.[19] Attempts to combine punk and country had been pioneered by Nashville's Jason and the Scorchers, and in the 1980s Southern Californian cowpunk scene with bands like the Long Ryders[21] and X,[22] and the Minneapolis-based band the Jayhawks. X signed with major label Elektra in 1982 and released Under the Big Black Sun, which marked a departure from their trademark sound. While still fast and loud, with raw punk guitars, the album displayed evolving country leanings. The Scorchers released their debut, D.I.Y. EP, Reckless Country Soul, in 1982 on the independent Praxis label. But these styles merged fully in Uncle Tupelo's 1990 LP No Depression, which is widely credited as being the first \"alt-country\" album, and gave its name to the online notice board and eventually magazine that underpinned the movement. In the 1990s and 2000s, Americana music underwent a resurgence in popularity, as a new generation of artists began incorporating elements of traditional American music into their songs. Artists such as Wilco, Lucinda Williams, and Gillian Welch helped to popularise a new style of Americana music that blended elements of rock, folk, country, and blues.[23][24] Rolling Stone notes that \"Americana\" first came to fashion as a descriptive musical phrase in the mid-Nineties, when a group of radio promoters and industry outsiders dispersed throughout Nashville, California and Texas sought to carve out a distinct marketplace for a wave of traditionally minded songwriters like Guy Clark, Darrell Scott and Jim Lauderdale, artists whose work was no longer being served by a country music industry riding high on Garth Brooks and Shania Twain.[25] This new style of music reflected a renewed interest in traditional American music forms, and it helped to establish Americana music as a distinct and important genre in its own right. The Americana Music Association, a not-for-profit trade organization advocating for American Roots Music around the world, was formed in 1999.[26] It is a network for Americana artists, radio stations, record labels, publishers, and others with the goal of developing an infrastructure that will boost visibility and economic viability. The 2010s saw several musical groups connected with Americana music finding their way on to the Billboard charts. Bands like Mumford and Sons, The Lumineers and The Avett Brothers helped bring contemporary Americana to more people than ever before. Their popularity as artists took the genre (which was somewhat of a niche, in the shadow of country and rock) and made it mainstream.[27] In 2011, the genre was officially inducted into the Merriam-Webster dictionary.[28] In modern times, Americana music continues to evolve and expand, as new generations of artists continue to draw inspiration from the rich history and cultural traditions of the United States. The instrumentation of Americana music continues to be characterized by acoustic guitars, fiddles, banjos, mandolins, and harmonicas, as well as electric guitars and drums. The genre remains deeply rooted in the cultural and social landscape of the United States, and it continues to reflect the diverse experiences and perspectives of the American people. In recent years, the genre has incorporated more influences from blues, R&B, and soul, in addition to the country and folk elements that have always been prominent. In 2017 Rolling Stone published an article claiming that Americana was having an \"identity crisis,\" which focused on changing definitions and efforts to promote ethnic diversity in the genre. In 2014, traditional country musician Dale Watson formed the Ameripolitan Music Awards, focused on the genres of honky tonk, outlaw, Western swing, and rockabilly, on the premise that these genres can no longer be properly categorized as country or Americana, thus necessitating the creation of a new term, \"Ameripolitan\". The radio station laying the best claim to the Americana radio format origins is KFAT in Gilroy, California, active from mid-1975 to January 1983, as described in the book Fat Chance,[29] authored by Gilbert Klein in 2016 and published by MainFramePress.com. KFAT was succeeded by KHIP in Hollister CA, KPIG in Freedom CA, and Fat 99 KPHT-LP in Laytonville CA. Though some[who?] say Americana as a radio format had its origins in 1984 on KCSN (\"college radio\") in Northridge, California, but that did not happen until after KFAT, Gilroy went off the air when it was sold and the format changed. Mark Humphrey, a contributor to country/folk Frets magazine, hosted a weekly radio show called \"Honky Tonk Amnesia\" which played \"country, folk, honky tonk, cajun, dawg, blues, and old-time music\", a combination that the country music station KCSN advertised as \"Americana\".[30] The format came into its own in the mid-1990s as a descriptive phrase used by radio promoters and music industry figures for traditionally-oriented songwriters and performers. Americana type radio shows can be heard on a variety of non commercial radio stations. The acoustic guitar is perhaps the most essential instrument in Americana music. It is often used to provide the rhythmic foundation of a song, as well as to accompany vocals and other instruments.[31] In Americana music, the acoustic guitar is often played fingerstyle, which produces a warm and organic sound that is perfect for the genre's earthy, rootsy feel.[32] The banjo is a distinctive and essential instrument in Americana music.[33] Its bright, twangy sound", "<3-hop>\n\nis instantly recognizable and often associated with Appalachian and bluegrass music also. Banjos are often played using a technique called clawhammer, which involves striking the strings with the back of the fingernail.[34] The banjo adds a unique texture to Americana music, and its intricate, fast-paced playing can create a driving rhythm that propels a song forward. The mandolin is a small, stringed instrument that is commonly used in folk and bluegrass music. Its bright, high-pitched sound adds a distinctive flavor to Americana music, and its fast, intricate playing can create a lively and upbeat feel. Mandolins are often played using a technique called tremolo, which involves rapidly picking the strings to create a sustained, shimmering sound.[35] The fiddle is a traditional stringed instrument that is often used in Americana music.[36] Its versatile sound can create both slow, mournful melodies and fast, lively rhythms. Fiddles are often played using a technique called \"sawing,\" which involves rapidly moving the bow back and forth across the strings to create a driving rhythm.[37] Fiddles can add a haunting quality to Americana music and can create a sense of nostalgia and longing. Despite the genre's most common name, it is not practiced solely by artists from the United States, as numerous artists from Canada are also prominent in the genre.[38] Canadian bands in the genre will sometimes be referred to as Canadiana rather than Americana in Canadian media,[39] although this is not a widely recognized synonym elsewhere. A Norwegian scene is often referred to as Nordicana.[40]"], "reference": "Americana music's genre evolution led to alternative country as musicians moved outside mainstream country traditions, often incorporating a lo-fi sound with punk and rock and roll aesthetics.

{"user_input": "I am very curious about how Italo disco, which originated in Italy in the late 1970s, was adapted for the Japanese market and what specific genre emerged from this adaptation, considering the influence of labels like S.A.I.F.A.M.?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nItalo disco (variously capitalized, and sometimes hyphenated as Italo-disco)[1] is a music genre which originated in Italy in the late 1970s and was mainly produced in the 1980s. Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign (hi-NRG, Euro disco) and developed into a diverse genre.[2] The genre employs electronic drums, drum machines, synthesizers, and occasionally vocoders. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish. The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982.[3] Italo disco faded in the early 1990s, then split into many genres (Eurobeat, Italo house, Italo dance). The term \"Italo\", a generic prefix meaning Italian, had been used on pop music compilation albums in West Germany as early as 1978, such as Italo Top Hits on the K-Tel label and the first volume of Italo Super Hits on the Ariola label.[4] There is no documentation of where the term \"Italo-Disco\" first appeared, but its origins are generally traced to Italian and other European disco recordings released in the West German market. Examples include the phrase \"Original Italo-Disco\" on the sleeve of the West German edition of \"Girls on Me\" by Amin-Peck in 1982, and the 1983 compilation album The Best of Italo-Disco.[5] These records, along with the Italo Boot Mix megamix, were released by Bernhard Mikulski on his ZYX label, who was therefore credited with coining the term \"Italo disco\".[1][6] The Best of and Boot Mix compilations each became a 16-volume series that culminated in 1991. Both series primarily featured disco music of Italian origin, often licensed from independent Italian labels which had limited distribution outside Italy, as well as songs in a similar style by other European artists. The presenters of the Italian music show Discoring (produced by RAI) usually referred to Italo disco tracks as \"rock elettronico\" (electronic rock) or \"balli da discoteca\" (disco dance) before the term \"Italo disco\" came into existence. Italo disco originated in Europe in the late 1970s. After Disco Demolition Night in 1979, American interest in disco sharply declined, whereas in Europe the genre maintained mainstream popularity and survived into the 1980s. The adoption of synthesizers and other electronic instruments by disco artists led to electronic dance music, which spawned many subgenres such as hi-NRG in America and space disco in Europe. Italo disco's influences include Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, French musician Didier Marouani, Italo-French drummer Cerrone, and the San Francisco-based hi-NRG producer Patrick Cowley, who worked with singers as Sylvester and Paul Parker. In the late 1970s, Italo disco group D.D. Sound (La Bionda) released the song \"1, 2, 3, 4, Gimme Some More\".[7] In 1979, Jacques Fred Petrus and Mauro Malavasi created the soulful post-disco groups Change and B.B. & Q. Band.[8] In 1981, both groups gained US R&B and Dance hits with \"Paradise\" and \"On the Beat\" respectively. Italo disco often features electronic sounds, electronic drums, drum machines, catchy melodies, vocoders, overdubs, and heavily accented English lyrics. By 1983, Italo disco's instrumentation was predominantly electronic. Along with love, Italo disco themes deal with robots and space, sometimes combining all three in songs like \"Robot Is Systematic\" (1982) by Lectric Workers and \"Spacer Woman\" (1983) by Charlie. Then also new musical genres that had set aside the rock of the 1970s thanks to new groups, such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Spandau Ballet and great pop artists Michael Jackson and Madonna. The 1980s brought the electronics with real instruments, experimenting new sounds, in short, it was a decade of great change in modern music.[9] In 1983, there were frequent hit singles, and labels such as American Disco, Crash, Merak, Sensation and X-Energy appeared. The popular label Discomagic Records released more than thirty singles within the year. It was also the year that the term \"Italo disco\" became widely known outside Italy, with the release of the first volumes of The Best of Italo Disco compilation series on the West German record label ZYX. After 1983, Italo disco was also produced outside Italy. Although Italo disco was successful in mainland Europe during the 1980s, only a few singles reached the UK charts, such as Ryan Paris's \"Dolce Vita\", Laura Branigan's \"Self Control\", Baltimora's \"Tarzan Boy\", Spagna's \"Call Me\" and Sabrina's \"Boys\", all of which were top 5 hits. Italo disco maintained an influence in the UK's underground music scenes in the UK, and its impact can be heard in the music of several British electronic acts such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order.[1] Canada, particularly Quebec, produced several remarkable Italo disco acts, including Trans X (\"Living on Video\"), Lime (\"Angel Eyes\"), Rational Youth (\"City of Night\"), Pluton & the Humanoids (\"World Invaders\"), Purple Flash Orchestra (\"We Can Make It\"), and Tapps (\"Forbidden Lover\"). Those productions were called \"Canadian disco\" during 1980–1984 in Europe and hi-NRG disco in the U.S. In English-speaking countries, it was called Italo disco and hi-NRG. In Mexico the style is known just as \"disco\", having nothing to do with the 1970s genre.[citation needed] West German productions were sung in English and were characterized by an emphasis on melody, exaggerated production, and a more earnest approach to the themes of love; examples may be found in the works of: Modern Talking, Fancy, American-born singer and Fancy protégé Grant Miller, Bad Boys Blue, Joy, Silent Circle, the Twins, Lian Ross, C. C. Catch, Blue System and London Boys. During the mid-1980s, spacesynth, a derivation of Italo disco, developed. It was mostly instrumental, featured space sounds, and was exemplified by musicians, such as: Koto, Proxyon, Rofo, Cyber People, Hipnosis, Laserdance and Mike Mareen (whose music inhabited the spacesynth/hi-NRG overlap). As Italo disco declined in Europe, Italian and West German producers adapted the sound to Japanese tastes, creating \"Eurobeat\".[11] Music produced in this style is sold exclusively in Japan due to the country's Para Para culture, produced by Italian producers for the", "<2-hop>\n\nJapanese market. The two most famous Eurobeat labels are A-Beat-C Records and Time Records. One traditional Italo disco label, S.A.I.F.A.M., still produces Eurobeat music for Japan. Around 1989 in Italy, Italo disco evolved into Italo house when Italian Italo disco artists experimented with harder beats and the \"house\" sound. Space disco is a type of dance music using synthesizers and space-like sounds and themes.[citation needed][12] At least one modern history of \"space disco\" traces the genre's origins to science fiction themes (outer space, robots, and the future) in the titles, lyrics and cover artwork of dance music in the late 1970s.[13] Plausible associations are drawn between the popularity of Star Wars (released mid-1977), the subsequent surge of interest in science fiction themes in popular culture, and the release of a number of science fiction themed and \"futuristic\"-sounding (synthesizer and arpeggiator-infused) disco music worldwide.[13][14] The most commercially successful space disco tracks were \"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band\" (1977) by Meco, and \"Automatic Lover\" (1978) by Dee D. Jackson, with each song reaching the top ten in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom. Even in Italy the Space genre had some followers, including I Signori della Galassia who showed up with glam sci-fi inspired clothes and whose album Iceman is still highly sought after by collectors today.[15] Additional examples of space disco usually include the compositions \"Just Blue\" and \"Symphony\" (both 1978) of French band Space,[13] the same for the track Magic Fly; additional tracks by Dee D. Jackson during the 1970s and 1980s, and \"I Feel Space\"[14] by Lindstrøm. Labels producing this type of music include[14] New York City-based post-disco record label Emergency Records specialized in reissuing/selling records from Italy (e.g. Kano \"I'm Ready\"),[16] since the 1970s. Kano is noted for incorporating American musical elements (\"heavy funk\" influences, \"breakbeat\" rhythm, the use of vocoder) with electronic music while using rudimentary synthesizers,[9] constituting one of the earliest forms of Italo disco. This form of Americanized Italo disco, that also includes Klein + M.B.O.[9] (\"Dirty Talk\", \"Wonderful\", \"The M. B. O. Theme\"), re-entered the States and was known to be influential on the development of house music.[9] Doctor's Cat (\"Feel the Drive\"), likewise, was one of the earliest \"house music\" songs.[17] Record labels include"], "reference": "As Italo disco declined in Europe, Italian and West German producers adapted the sound to Japanese tastes, creating \"Eurobeat\".

Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign (hi-NRG, Euro disco) and developed into a diverse genre.[2] The genre employs electronic drums, drum machines, synthesizers, and occasionally vocoders. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish. The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982.[3] Italo disco faded in the early 1990s, then split into many genres (Eurobeat, Italo house, Italo dance). The term \"Italo\", a generic prefix meaning Italian, had been used on pop music compilation albums in West Germany as early as 1978, such as Italo Top Hits on the K-Tel label and the first volume of Italo Super Hits on the Ariola label.[4] There is no documentation of where the term \"Italo-Disco\" first appeared, but its origins are generally traced to Italian and other European disco recordings released in the West German market. Examples include the phrase \"Original Italo-Disco\" on the sleeve of the West German edition of \"Girls on Me\" by Amin-Peck in 1982, and the 1983 compilation album The Best of Italo-Disco.[5] These records, along with the Italo Boot Mix megamix, were released by Bernhard Mikulski on his ZYX label, who was therefore credited with coining the term \"Italo disco\".[1][6] The Best of and Boot Mix compilations each became a 16-volume series that culminated in 1991. Both series primarily featured disco music of Italian origin, often licensed from independent Italian labels which had limited distribution outside Italy, as well as songs in a similar style by other European artists. The presenters of the Italian music show Discoring (produced by RAI) usually referred to Italo disco tracks as \"rock elettronico\" (electronic rock) or \"balli da discoteca\" (disco dance) before the term \"Italo disco\" came into existence. Italo disco originated in Europe in the late 1970s. After Disco Demolition Night in 1979, American interest in disco sharply declined, whereas in Europe the genre maintained mainstream popularity and survived into the 1980s. The adoption of synthesizers and other electronic instruments by disco artists led to electronic dance music, which spawned many subgenres such as hi-NRG in America and space disco in Europe. Italo disco's influences include Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, French musician Didier Marouani, Italo-French drummer Cerrone, and the San Francisco-based hi-NRG producer Patrick Cowley, who worked with singers as Sylvester and Paul Parker. In the late 1970s, Italo disco group D.D. Sound (La Bionda) released the song \"1, 2, 3, 4, Gimme Some More\".[7] In 1979, Jacques Fred Petrus and Mauro Malavasi created the soulful post-disco groups Change and B.B. & Q. Band.[8] In 1981, both groups gained US R&B and Dance hits with \"Paradise\" and \"On the Beat\" respectively. Italo disco often features electronic sounds, electronic drums, drum machines, catchy melodies, vocoders, overdubs, and heavily accented English lyrics. By 1983, Italo disco's instrumentation was predominantly electronic. Along with love, Italo disco themes deal with robots and space, sometimes combining all three in songs like \"Robot Is Systematic\" (1982) by Lectric Workers and \"Spacer Woman\" (1983) by Charlie. Then also new musical genres that had set aside the rock of the 1970s thanks to new groups, such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Spandau Ballet and great pop artists Michael Jackson and Madonna. The 1980s brought the electronics with real instruments, experimenting new sounds, in short, it was a decade of great change in modern music.[9] In 1983, there were frequent hit singles, and labels such as American Disco, Crash, Merak, Sensation and X-Energy appeared. The popular label Discomagic Records released more than thirty singles within the year. It was also the year that the term \"Italo disco\" became widely known outside Italy, with the release of the first volumes of The Best of Italo Disco compilation series on the West German record label ZYX. After 1983, Italo disco was also produced outside Italy. Although Italo disco was successful in mainland Europe during the 1980s, only a few singles reached the UK charts, such as Ryan Paris's \"Dolce Vita\", Laura Branigan's \"Self Control\", Baltimora's \"Tarzan Boy\", Spagna's \"Call Me\" and Sabrina's \"Boys\", all of which were top 5 hits. Italo disco maintained an influence in the UK's underground music scenes in the UK, and its impact can be heard in the music of several British electronic acts such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order.[1] Canada, particularly Quebec, produced several remarkable Italo disco acts, including Trans X (\"Living on Video\"), Lime (\"Angel Eyes\"), Rational Youth (\"City of Night\"), Pluton & the Humanoids (\"World Invaders\"), Purple Flash Orchestra (\"We Can Make It\"), and Tapps (\"Forbidden Lover\"). Those productions were called \"Canadian disco\" during 1980–1984 in Europe and hi-NRG disco in the U.S. In English-speaking countries, it was called Italo disco and hi-NRG. In Mexico the style is known just as \"disco\", having nothing to do with the 1970s genre.[citation needed] West German productions were sung in English and were characterized by an emphasis on melody, exaggerated production, and a more earnest approach to the themes of love; examples may be found in the works of: Modern Talking, Fancy, American-born singer and Fancy protégé Grant Miller, Bad Boys Blue, Joy, Silent Circle, the Twins, Lian Ross, C. C. Catch, Blue System and London Boys. During the mid-1980s, spacesynth, a derivation of Italo disco, developed. It was mostly instrumental, featured space sounds, and was exemplified by musicians, such as: Koto, Proxyon, Rofo, Cyber People, Hipnosis, Laserdance and Mike Mareen (whose music inhabited the spacesynth/hi-NRG overlap).

The term \"Americana music\" was defined by the Americana Music Association (AMA) in 2020 as \"…the rich threads of country, folk, blues, soul, bluegrass, gospel, and rock in our tapestry.\"[2] A previous 2016 AMA definition of the genre included rhythm and blues, with additional comments that Americana music results \"in a distinctive roots-oriented sound that lives in a world apart from the pure forms of the genres upon which it may draw. While acoustic instruments are often present and vital, Americana also often uses a full electric band.\"[3] The origins of Americana music can be traced back to the early 20th century, when rural American musicians began incorporating elements of folk, blues, and country music into their songs.[4] Americana musicians often played acoustic instruments such as the guitar, banjo, fiddle, and upright bass, and their songs typically told stories about the struggles and hardships of everyday life.[5] The American folk music revival began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. The folk revival in New York City was rooted in the resurgent interest in square dancing and folk dancing there in the 1940s as espoused by instructors such as Margot Mayo, which gave musicians such as Pete Seeger popular exposure.[6][7][8] The folk revival more generally as a popular and commercial phenomenon begins with the career of The Weavers, formed in November 1948 by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman, and Ronnie Gilbert of People's Songs, of which Seeger had been president and Hays executive secretary. The Kingston Trio, a group originating on the West Coast, were directly inspired by the Weavers in their style and presentation and covered some of the Weavers' material, which was predominantly traditional. The Kingston Trio's popularity would be followed by that of Joan Baez, whose debut album Joan Baez reached the top ten in late 1960 and remained on the Billboard charts for over two years. It was not long before the folk-music category came to include less traditional material and more personal and poetic creations by individual performers, who called themselves \"singer-songwriters\". As a result of the financial success of high-profile commercial folk artists, record companies began to produce and distribute records by a new generation of folk revival and singer-songwriters Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Eric von Schmidt, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Dave Van Ronk, Judy Collins, Tom Rush, Fred Neil, Gordon Lightfoot, Billy Ed Wheeler, John Denver, John Stewart, Arlo Guthrie, Harry Chapin, and John Hartford, among others. Some of this wave had emerged from family singing and playing traditions, and some had not. These singers frequently prided themselves on performing traditional material in imitations of the style of the source singers whom they had discovered, frequently by listening to Harry Smith's celebrated LP compilation of forgotten or obscure commercial 78rpm \"race\" and \"hillbilly\" recordings of the 1920s and 30s, the Folkways Anthology of American Folk Music (1951). A number of the artists who had made these old recordings were still very much alive and had been \"rediscovered\" and brought to the 1963 and 64 Newport Folk Festivals. For example, traditionalist Clarence Ashley introduced folk revivalists to the music of friends of his who still actively played the older music, such as Doc Watson and The Stanley Brothers. In the 1950s and 1960s, folk revival music began to evolve and incorporate elements of rock and roll and other popular music styles. Artists such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds began blending traditional folk and country music with electric guitars and drums, creating a new sound that came to be known as folk rock.[4] On January 20, 1965, the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to record Bob Dylan's acoustic tune \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" for release as their debut single on Columbia. The full, electric rock band treatment that the Byrds and producer Terry Melcher had given the song effectively created the template for the musical subgenre of folk rock.[9][10] McGuinn's melodic, jangling 12-string Rickenbacker guitar playing—which was heavily compressed to produce an extremely bright and sustained tone—was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day. The single also featured another major characteristic of the band's sound: their clear harmony singing, which usually featured McGuinn and Clark in unison, with Crosby providing the high harmony.[11] Additionally, Richie Unterberger has stated that the song's abstract lyrics took rock and pop songwriting to new heights; never before had such intellectual and literary wordplay been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group.[12] Within three months \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" had become the first folk rock smash hit,[13] reaching number one on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[14][15] The single's success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, during which a number of Byrds-influenced acts had hits on the American and British charts.[12] The term \"folk rock\" was itself coined by the American music press to describe the band's sound in June 1965, at roughly the same time as \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" peaked at number 1 in the U.S.[16][17] The commercial success of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and their debut album of the same name, along with Dylan's own recordings with rock instrumentation—on the albums Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965), and Blonde on Blonde (1966)—encouraged other folk acts, such as Simon & Garfunkel, to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as Buffalo Springfield, to form. Dylan's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25, 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre.
