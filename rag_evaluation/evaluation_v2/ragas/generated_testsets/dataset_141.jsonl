First produced in the 1920s, country music is primarily focused on singing stories about working-class and blue-collar American life.[2] Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (i.e., \"honky-tonk music\") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies generally accompanied by instruments such as banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and many types of guitar (including acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator guitars).[3][4][5] Though it is primarily rooted in various forms of American folk music, such as old-time music and Appalachian music,[6][7] many other traditions, including Mexican, Irish, and Hawaiian music, have had a formative influence on the genre.[8] Blues modes from blues music have been used extensively throughout its history as well.[9] Once called \"hillbilly music\", the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s. The genre came to encompass western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. Contemporary styles of western music include Texas country, red dirt, and Hispano- and Mexican American-led Tejano and New Mexico music,[10][11] which still exists alongside longstanding indigenous traditions. In 2009, in the United States, country music was the most-listened-to rush-hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second-most popular in the morning commute.[12] The main components of the modern country music style date back to music traditions throughout the Southern United States and Southwestern United States, while its place in American popular music was established in the 1920s during the early days of music recording.[13] According to country historian Bill C. Malone, country music was \"introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon.\"[14] Migration into the southern Appalachian Mountains, of the Southeastern United States, brought the folk music and instruments of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin along with it for nearly 300 years, which developed into Appalachian music. As the country expanded westward, the Mississippi River and Louisiana became a crossroads for country music, giving rise to Cajun music. In the Southwestern United States, it was the Rocky Mountains, American frontier, and Rio Grande that acted as a similar backdrop for Native American, Mexican, and cowboy ballads, which resulted in New Mexico music and the development of western music, and it is directly related to Red Dirt, Texas country, and Tejano music styles. In the Asia-Pacific, the steel guitar sound of country music has its provenance in the music of Hawaii.[15][16] The U.S. Congress has formally recognized Bristol, Tennessee, as the \"Birthplace of Country Music\",[17] based on the historic Bristol recording sessions of 1927.[18][19][20] Since 2014, the city has been home to the Birthplace of Country Music Museum.[21][22] Historians have also noted the influence of the less-known Johnson City sessions of 1928 and 1929,[23][24] and the Knoxville sessions of 1929 and 1930.[25] In addition, the Mountain City Fiddlers Convention, held in 1925, helped to inspire modern country music. Before these, pioneer settlers, in the Great Smoky Mountains region, had developed a rich musical heritage.[26] The first generation emerged in the 1920s, with Atlanta's music scene playing a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists. James Gideon \"Gid\" Tanner (1885–1960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the Skillet Lickers, was one of the most innovative and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were Clayton McMichen (fiddle and vocal), Dan Hornsby (vocals), Riley Puckett (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label Okeh Records began issuing hillbilly music records by Fiddlin' John Carson as early as 1923, followed by Columbia Records (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") (Samantha Bumgarner) in 1924, and RCA Victor Records in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre Jimmie Rodgers, who is widely considered the \"Father of Country Music\", and the first family of country music the Carter Family.[27] Many \"hillbilly\" musicians recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.[28] During the second generation (1930s–1940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring Gene Autry, who was known as king of the \"singing cowboys,\" and Hank Williams. Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a \"hot string band,\" and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as western swing. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.[29] Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\". The third generation (1950s–1960s) started at the end of World War II with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as bluegrass, which emerged when Bill Monroe, along with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, were introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. Gospel music remained a popular component of country music. The Native American, Hispano, and American frontier music of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, became popular among poor communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; the basic ensemble consisted of classical guitar, bass guitar, dobro or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured electric guitars, trumpets, keyboards (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of tack piano), banjos, and drums.

Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee; Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the 1950s to the mid-1960s, western singer-songwriters such as Marty Robbins rose in prominence as did others, throughout western music traditions, like New Mexico music's Al Hurricane. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the British Invasion, many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as country rock. Fourth generation (1970s–1980s) music included outlaw country with roots in the Bakersfield sound, and country pop with roots in the countrypolitan, folk music and soft rock. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, Texas country and Tejano music gained popularity with performers like Freddie Fender. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production. During the fifth generation (the 1990s), neotraditionalists and stadium country acts prospered. The sixth generation (2000s–present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. It has also, however, seen a shift into patriotism and conservative politics since 9/11, though such themes are less prevalent in more modern trends.[30] The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were those by Lady A, Florida Georgia Line, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift.[31] Hip hop also made its mark on country music with the emergence of country rap.[32] The first commercial recordings of what was considered instrumental music in the traditional country style were \"Arkansas Traveler\" and \"Turkey in the Straw\" by fiddlers Henry Gilliland & A.C. (Eck) Robertson on June 30, 1922, for Victor Records and released in April 1923.[33][34] Columbia Records began issuing records with \"hillbilly\" music (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") as early as 1924.[27] The first commercial recording of what is widely considered to be the first country song featuring vocals and lyrics was Fiddlin' John Carson with \"Little Log Cabin in the Lane\" for Okeh Records on June 14, 1923.[35][36] Vernon Dalhart was the first country singer to have a nationwide hit in May 1924 with \"Wreck of the Old 97\".[37][38] The flip side of the record was \"Lonesome Road Blues\", which also became very popular.[39] In April 1924, \"Aunt\" Samantha Bumgarner and Eva Davis became the first female musicians to record and release country songs.[40] The record 129-D produced by Columbia features Samantha playing fiddle and singing Big-Eyed Rabbit while Eva Davis plays banjo. The other side features Eva Davis playing banjo while singing Wild Bill Jones. Many of the early country musicians, such as the yodeler Cliff Carlisle, recorded blues songs into the 1930s.[41] Other important early recording artists were Riley Puckett, Don Richardson, Fiddlin' John Carson, Uncle Dave Macon, Al Hopkins, Ernest V. Stoneman, Blind Alfred Reed, Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers and the Skillet Lickers.[42] The steel guitar entered country music as early as 1922, when Jimmie Tarlton met famed Hawaiian guitarist Frank Ferera on the West Coast.[43] Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family are widely considered to be important early country musicians. From Scott County, Virginia, the Carters had learned sight reading of hymnals and sheet music using solfege.[citation needed] Their songs were first captured at a historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee, on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and sound recordist.[44][45] A scene in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? depicts a similar occurrence in the same timeframe. Rodgers fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk, and many of his best songs were his compositions, including \"Blue Yodel\",[46] which sold over a million records and established Rodgers as the premier singer of early country music.[47][48] Beginning in 1927, and for the next 17 years, the Carters recorded some 300 old-time ballads, traditional tunes, country songs and gospel hymns, all representative of America's southeastern folklore and heritage.[49] Maybelle Carter went on to continue the family tradition with her daughters as The Carter Sisters; her daughter June would marry (in succession) Carl Smith, Rip Nix and Johnny Cash, having children with each who would also become country singers. Record sales declined during the Great Depression. However, radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started by radio stations all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day.[50] Some of the early stars on the Opry were Uncle Dave Macon, Roy Acuff and African American harmonica player DeFord Bailey. WSM's 50,000-watt signal (in 1934) could often be heard across the country.[51] Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. Moon Mullican, for example, played western swing but also recorded songs that can be called rockabilly. Between 1947 and 1949, country crooner Eddy Arnold placed eight songs in the top 10.[52] From 1945 to 1955 Jenny Lou Carson was one"], "reference": "Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee; Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

Some of the popular singing cowboys from the era were Gene Autry, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Roy Rogers.[54] Country music and western music were frequently played together on the same radio stations, hence the term country and western music, despite country and western being two distinct genres. Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. Patsy Montana opened the door for female artists with her history-making song \"I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\". This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a \"hot string band,\" and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as western swing. Cliff Bruner, Moon Mullican, Milton Brown and Adolph Hofner were other early western swing pioneers. Spade Cooley and Tex Williams also had very popular bands and appeared in films. At its height, western swing rivaled the popularity of big band swing music. Drums were scorned by early country musicians as being \"too loud\" and \"not pure\", but by 1935 western swing big band leader Bob Wills had added drums to the Texas Playboys. In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand-Ole-Opry Louisiana Hayride kept its infrequently used drummer backstage as late as 1956. By the early 1960s, however, it was rare for a country band not to have a drummer.[55] Bob Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.[29] A decade later (1948) Arthur Smith achieved top 10 US country chart success with his MGM Records recording of \"Guitar Boogie\", which crossed over to the US pop chart, introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar. For several decades Nashville session players preferred the warm tones of the Gibson and Gretsch archtop electrics, but a \"hot\" Fender style, using guitars which became available beginning in the early 1950s, eventually prevailed as the signature guitar sound of country.[55][56] Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\". The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning in late 1945. One notable release from this period was the Delmore Brothers' \"Freight Train Boogie\", considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards rockabilly. In 1948, Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith achieved top ten US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of \"Guitar Boogie\" and \"Banjo Boogie\", with the former crossing over to the US pop charts.[57] Other country boogie artists included Moon Mullican, Merrill Moore and Tennessee Ernie Ford. The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s and remains one of many subgenres of country into the 21st century. By the end of World War II, \"mountaineer\" string band music known as bluegrass had emerged when Bill Monroe joined with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. That was the ordination of bluegrass music and how Bill Monroe came to be known as the \"Father of Bluegrass.\" Gospel music, too, remained a popular component of bluegrass and other sorts of country music. Red Foley, the biggest country star following World War II, had one of the first million-selling gospel hits (\"Peace in the Valley\") and also sang boogie, blues and rockabilly. In the post-war period, country music was called \"folk\" in the trades, and \"hillbilly\" within the industry.[58] In 1944, Billboard replaced the term \"hillbilly\" with \"folk songs and blues,\" and switched to \"country and western\" in 1949.[59][60] Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among rural residents in the three states of Texhomex, those being Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.[61] It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly New Mexico and Texas,[62] together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as \"a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white ... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey.\"[63] East Texan Al Dexter had a hit with \"Honky Tonk Blues\", and seven years later \"Pistol Packin' Mama\".[64] These \"honky tonk\" songs were associated with barrooms, and was performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams; the music of these artists would later be called \"traditional\" country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll,[65] such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones. Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four. By the early 1950s, a blend of western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands, a mixture which followed in the footsteps of Gene Autry, Lydia"], "reference": "Cliff Bruner, Moon Mullican, Milton Brown and Adolph Hofner were early western swing pioneers.

Influenced by one-time West Coast residents Bob Wills and Lefty Frizzell, by 1966 it was known as the Bakersfield sound. It relied on electric instruments and amplification, in particular the Telecaster electric guitar, more than other subgenres of the country music of the era, and it can be described as having a sharp, hard, driving, no-frills, edgy flavor—hard guitars and honky-tonk harmonies.[67] Leading practitioners of this style were Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, Tommy Collins, Dwight Yoakam, Gary Allan, and Wynn Stewart, each of whom had his own style.[78][79] Ken Nelson, who had produced Owens and Haggard and Rose Maddox became interested in the trucking song subgenre following the success of Six Days on the Road and asked Red Simpson to record an album of trucking songs. Haggard's White Line Fever was also part of the trucking subgenre.[67] The country music scene of the 1940s until the 1970s was largely dominated by western music influences, so much so that the genre began to be called \"country and western\".[80] Even today, cowboy and frontier values continue to play a role in the larger country music, with western wear, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats continues to be in fashion for country artists.[81] West of the Mississippi River, many of these western genres continue to flourish, including the Red Dirt of Oklahoma,[82] New Mexico music of New Mexico,[83] and both Texas country music and Tejano music of Texas.[84][85] During the 1950s until the early 1970s, the latter part of the western heyday in country music, many of these genres featured popular artists that continue to influence both their distinctive genres and larger country music. Red Dirt featured Bob Childers and Steve Ripley; for New Mexico music Al Hurricane, Al Hurricane Jr., and Antonia Apodaca; and within the Texas scenes Willie Nelson, Freddie Fender, Johnny Rodriguez, and Little Joe. As Outlaw country music emerged as subgenre in its own right, Red Dirt, New Mexico, Texas country, and Tejano grew in popularity as a part of the Outlaw country movement. Originating in the bars, fiestas, and honky-tonks of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas, their music supplemented outlaw country's singer-songwriter tradition as well as 21st-century rock-inspired alternative country and hip hop-inspired country rap artists.[86] Outlaw country was derived from the traditional western, including Red Dirt, New Mexico, Texas country, Tejano, and honky-tonk musical styles of the late 1950s and 1960s. Songs such as the 1963 Johnny Cash popularized \"Ring of Fire\" show clear influences from the likes of Al Hurricane and Little Joe, this influence just happened to culminate with artists such as Ray Price (whose band, the \"Cherokee Cowboys\", included Willie Nelson and Roger Miller) and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period, a collection of musicians that came to be known as the outlaw movement revolutionized the genre of country music in the early 1970s.[87][88] \"After I left Nashville (the early 70s), I wanted to relax and play the music that I wanted to play, and just stay around Texas, maybe Oklahoma. Waylon and I had that outlaw image going, and when it caught on at colleges and we started selling records, we were O.K. The whole outlaw thing, it had nothing to do with the music, it was something that got written in an article, and the young people said, 'Well, that's pretty cool.' And started listening.\" (Willie Nelson)[89] The term outlaw country is traditionally associated with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker,[90] Hank Williams, Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings and Joe Ely.[91] It was encapsulated in the 1976 album Wanted! The Outlaws. Though the outlaw movement as a cultural fad had died down after the late 1970s (with Jennings noting in 1978 that it had gotten out of hand and led to real-life legal scrutiny), many western and outlaw country music artists maintained their popularity during the 1980s by forming supergroups, such as The Highwaymen,[92] Texas Tornados,[93] and Bandido.[94] Country pop or soft pop, with roots in the countrypolitan sound, folk music, and soft rock, is a subgenre that first emerged in the 1970s. Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to adult contemporary music. It started with pop music singers like Glen Campbell, Bobbie Gentry, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, Anne Murray, B. J. Thomas, the Bellamy Brothers, and Linda Ronstadt having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"Rocky Mountain High\", \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\", \"Annie's Song\", \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\", and \"I'm Sorry\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Jean Shepard and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement. During the mid-1970s, Dolly Parton, a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"Here You Come Again\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the"], "reference": "It rate \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" number three for the year on Billboard's pop chart.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee; Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the 1950s to the mid-1960s, western singer-songwriters such as Marty Robbins rose in prominence as did others, throughout western music traditions, like New Mexico music's Al Hurricane. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the British Invasion, many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as country rock. Fourth generation (1970s–1980s) music included outlaw country with roots in the Bakersfield sound, and country pop with roots in the countrypolitan, folk music and soft rock. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, Texas country and Tejano music gained popularity with performers like Freddie Fender. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production. During the fifth generation (the 1990s), neotraditionalists and stadium country acts prospered. The sixth generation (2000s–present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. It has also, however, seen a shift into patriotism and conservative politics since 9/11, though such themes are less prevalent in more modern trends.[30] The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were those by Lady A, Florida Georgia Line, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift.[31] Hip hop also made its mark on country music with the emergence of country rap.[32] The first commercial recordings of what was considered instrumental music in the traditional country style were \"Arkansas Traveler\" and \"Turkey in the Straw\" by fiddlers Henry Gilliland & A.C. (Eck) Robertson on June 30, 1922, for Victor Records and released in April 1923.[33][34] Columbia Records began issuing records with \"hillbilly\" music (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") as early as 1924.[27] The first commercial recording of what is widely considered to be the first country song featuring vocals and lyrics was Fiddlin' John Carson with \"Little Log Cabin in the Lane\" for Okeh Records on June 14, 1923.[35][36] Vernon Dalhart was the first country singer to have a nationwide hit in May 1924 with \"Wreck of the Old 97\".[37][38] The flip side of the record was \"Lonesome Road Blues\", which also became very popular.[39] In April 1924, \"Aunt\" Samantha Bumgarner and Eva Davis became the first female musicians to record and release country songs.[40] The record 129-D produced by Columbia features Samantha playing fiddle and singing Big-Eyed Rabbit while Eva Davis plays banjo. The other side features Eva Davis playing banjo while singing Wild Bill Jones. Many of the early country musicians, such as the yodeler Cliff Carlisle, recorded blues songs into the 1930s.[41] Other important early recording artists were Riley Puckett, Don Richardson, Fiddlin' John Carson, Uncle Dave Macon, Al Hopkins, Ernest V. Stoneman, Blind Alfred Reed, Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers and the Skillet Lickers.[42] The steel guitar entered country music as early as 1922, when Jimmie Tarlton met famed Hawaiian guitarist Frank Ferera on the West Coast.[43] Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family are widely considered to be important early country musicians. From Scott County, Virginia, the Carters had learned sight reading of hymnals and sheet music using solfege.[citation needed] Their songs were first captured at a historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee, on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and sound recordist.[44][45] A scene in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? depicts a similar occurrence in the same timeframe. Rodgers fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk, and many of his best songs were his compositions, including \"Blue Yodel\",[46] which sold over a million records and established Rodgers as the premier singer of early country music.[47][48] Beginning in 1927, and for the next 17 years, the Carters recorded some 300 old-time ballads, traditional tunes, country songs and gospel hymns, all representative of America's southeastern folklore and heritage.[49] Maybelle Carter went on to continue the family tradition with her daughters as The Carter Sisters; her daughter June would marry (in succession) Carl Smith, Rip Nix and Johnny Cash, having children with each who would also become country singers. Record sales declined during the Great Depression. However, radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started by radio stations all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day.[50] Some of the early stars on the Opry were Uncle Dave Macon, Roy Acuff and African American harmonica player DeFord Bailey. WSM's 50,000-watt signal (in 1934) could often be heard across the country.[51] Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. Moon Mullican, for example, played western swing but also recorded songs that can be called rockabilly. Between 1947 and 1949, country crooner Eddy Arnold placed eight songs in the top 10.[52] From 1945 to 1955 Jenny Lou Carson was one", "<3-hop>\n\nMendoza, Roy Rogers, and Patsy Montana. Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads, New Mexico, Texas country and Tejano music rhythms of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song \"El Paso\", first recorded by Marty Robbins in September 1959. Western music's influence would continue to grow within the country music sphere, western musicians like Michael Martin Murphey, New Mexico music artists Al Hurricane and Antonia Apodaca, Tejano music performer Little Joe, and even folk revivalist John Denver, all first rose to prominence during this time. This western music influence largely kept the music of the folk revival and folk rock from influencing the country music genre much, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, the Byrds' negative reception during their appearance on the Grand Ole Opry). The main concern was largely political: most folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. John Denver was perhaps the only musician to have major success in both the country and folk revival genres throughout his career, later only a handful of artists like Burl Ives and Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot successfully made the crossover to country after folk revival fell out of fashion. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.[66] In 1953, the first all-country radio station was established in Lubbock, Texas.[67] The music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and truckers in particular. As country radio became more popular, trucking songs like the 1963 hit song Six Days on the Road by Dave Dudley began to make up their own subgenre of country. These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a \"new folk hero\", marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music. The song was written by actual truckers and contained numerous references to the trucker culture of the time like \"ICC\" for Interstate Commerce Commission and \"little white pills\" as a reference to amphetamines. Starday Records in Nashville followed up on Dudley's initial success with the release of Give Me 40 Acres by the Willis Brothers.[67] Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s; one of the first rock and roll superstars was former western yodeler Bill Haley, who repurposed his Four Aces of Western Swing into a rock and roll band in the early 1950s and renamed it the Comets. Bill Haley & His Comets are credited with two of the first successful rock and roll records, \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" of 1953 and \"Rock Around the Clock\" in 1954.[68] 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly in country music. Rockabilly was an early form of rock and roll, an upbeat combination of blues and country music.[69] The number two, three and four songs on Billboard's charts for that year were Elvis Presley, \"Heartbreak Hotel\"; Johnny Cash, \"I Walk the Line\"; and Carl Perkins, \"Blue Suede Shoes\". Reflecting this success, George Jones released a rockabilly record that year under the pseudonym \"Thumper Jones\", wanting to capitalize on the popularity of rockabilly without alienating his traditional country base.[70] Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 \"Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger\" by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley \"Don't/I Beg of You.\"[71] Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues artists and his style, saying \"The colored folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know.\" Within a few years, many rockabilly musicians returned to a more mainstream style or had defined their own unique style. Country music gained national television exposure through Ozark Jubilee on ABC-TV and radio from 1955 to 1960 from Springfield, Missouri. The program showcased top stars including several rockabilly artists, some from the Ozarks. As Webb Pierce put it in 1956, \"Once upon a time, it was almost impossible to sell country music in a place like New York City. Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else.\"[72] The Country Music Association was founded in 1958, in part because numerous country musicians were appalled by the increased influence of rock and roll on country music.[73] Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee. Under the direction of producers such as Chet Atkins, Bill Porter, Paul Cohen, Owen Bradley, Bob Ferguson, and later Billy Sherrill, the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period. This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a string section (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark \"licks\". Leading artists in this genre included Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, Connie Smith, the Browns,[74] Patsy Cline, and Eddy Arnold. The \"slip note\" piano style of session musician Floyd Cramer was an important component of this style.[75] The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the British Invasion and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into countrypolitan. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included Tammy Wynette, Lynn Anderson and Charlie Rich, as well as such former \"hard country\" artists as Ray Price and Marty Robbins. Despite the appeal of the Nashville sound, many traditional country artists emerged during this period and dominated the genre: Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, Porter Wagoner, George Jones, and Sonny James among them. In 1962, Ray Charles surprised the pop world by turning his attention to country and western"], "reference": "Country music originated in the southern regions of the United States.

{"user_input": "How did the Nashville Sound influence the country music genre, and what were some of the key characteristics of this style that emerged in the country music genre?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nCountry (also called country and western) is a music genre originating in the southern regions of the United States, both the American South and the Southwest. First produced in the 1920s, country music is primarily focused on singing stories about working-class and blue-collar American life.[2] Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (i.e., \"honky-tonk music\") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies generally accompanied by instruments such as banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and many types of guitar (including acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator guitars).[3][4][5] Though it is primarily rooted in various forms of American folk music, such as old-time music and Appalachian music,[6][7] many other traditions, including Mexican, Irish, and Hawaiian music, have had a formative influence on the genre.[8] Blues modes from blues music have been used extensively throughout its history as well.[9] Once called \"hillbilly music\", the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s. The genre came to encompass western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. Contemporary styles of western music include Texas country, red dirt, and Hispano- and Mexican American-led Tejano and New Mexico music,[10][11] which still exists alongside longstanding indigenous traditions. In 2009, in the United States, country music was the most-listened-to rush-hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second-most popular in the morning commute.[12] The main components of the modern country music style date back to music traditions throughout the Southern United States and Southwestern United States, while its place in American popular music was established in the 1920s during the early days of music recording.[13] According to country historian Bill C. Malone, country music was \"introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon.\"[14] Migration into the southern Appalachian Mountains, of the Southeastern United States, brought the folk music and instruments of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin along with it for nearly 300 years, which developed into Appalachian music. As the country expanded westward, the Mississippi River and Louisiana became a crossroads for country music, giving rise to Cajun music. In the Southwestern United States, it was the Rocky Mountains, American frontier, and Rio Grande that acted as a similar backdrop for Native American, Mexican, and cowboy ballads, which resulted in New Mexico music and the development of western music, and it is directly related to Red Dirt, Texas country, and Tejano music styles. In the Asia-Pacific, the steel guitar sound of country music has its provenance in the music of Hawaii.[15][16] The U.S. Congress has formally recognized Bristol, Tennessee, as the \"Birthplace of Country Music\",[17] based on the historic Bristol recording sessions of 1927.[18][19][20] Since 2014, the city has been home to the Birthplace of Country Music Museum.[21][22] Historians have also noted the influence of the less-known Johnson City sessions of 1928 and 1929,[23][24] and the Knoxville sessions of 1929 and 1930.[25] In addition, the Mountain City Fiddlers Convention, held in 1925, helped to inspire modern country music. Before these, pioneer settlers, in the Great Smoky Mountains region, had developed a rich musical heritage.[26] The first generation emerged in the 1920s, with Atlanta's music scene playing a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists. James Gideon \"Gid\" Tanner (1885–1960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the Skillet Lickers, was one of the most innovative and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were Clayton McMichen (fiddle and vocal), Dan Hornsby (vocals), Riley Puckett (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label Okeh Records began issuing hillbilly music records by Fiddlin' John Carson as early as 1923, followed by Columbia Records (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") (Samantha Bumgarner) in 1924, and RCA Victor Records in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre Jimmie Rodgers, who is widely considered the \"Father of Country Music\", and the first family of country music the Carter Family.[27] Many \"hillbilly\" musicians recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.[28] During the second generation (1930s–1940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring Gene Autry, who was known as king of the \"singing cowboys,\" and Hank Williams. Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a \"hot string band,\" and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as western swing. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.[29] Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\". The third generation (1950s–1960s) started at the end of World War II with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as bluegrass, which emerged when Bill Monroe, along with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, were introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. Gospel music remained a popular component of country music. The Native American, Hispano, and American frontier music of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, became popular among poor communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; the basic ensemble consisted of classical guitar, bass guitar, dobro or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured electric guitars, trumpets, keyboards (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of tack piano), banjos, and drums. By the early 1950s it blended with rock and roll, becoming the rockabilly sound produced by Sam Phillips, Norman Petty, and Bob Keane.

First produced in the 1920s, country music is primarily focused on singing stories about working-class and blue-collar American life.[2] Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (i.e., \"honky-tonk music\") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies generally accompanied by instruments such as banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and many types of guitar (including acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator guitars).[3][4][5] Though it is primarily rooted in various forms of American folk music, such as old-time music and Appalachian music,[6][7] many other traditions, including Mexican, Irish, and Hawaiian music, have had a formative influence on the genre.[8] Blues modes from blues music have been used extensively throughout its history as well.[9] Once called \"hillbilly music\", the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s. The genre came to encompass western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. Contemporary styles of western music include Texas country, red dirt, and Hispano- and Mexican American-led Tejano and New Mexico music,[10][11] which still exists alongside longstanding indigenous traditions. In 2009, in the United States, country music was the most-listened-to rush-hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second-most popular in the morning commute.[12] The main components of the modern country music style date back to music traditions throughout the Southern United States and Southwestern United States, while its place in American popular music was established in the 1920s during the early days of music recording.[13] According to country historian Bill C. Malone, country music was \"introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon.\"[14] Migration into the southern Appalachian Mountains, of the Southeastern United States, brought the folk music and instruments of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin along with it for nearly 300 years, which developed into Appalachian music. As the country expanded westward, the Mississippi River and Louisiana became a crossroads for country music, giving rise to Cajun music. In the Southwestern United States, it was the Rocky Mountains, American frontier, and Rio Grande that acted as a similar backdrop for Native American, Mexican, and cowboy ballads, which resulted in New Mexico music and the development of western music, and it is directly related to Red Dirt, Texas country, and Tejano music styles. In the Asia-Pacific, the steel guitar sound of country music has its provenance in the music of Hawaii.[15][16] The U.S. Congress has formally recognized Bristol, Tennessee, as the \"Birthplace of Country Music\",[17] based on the historic Bristol recording sessions of 1927.[18][19][20] Since 2014, the city has been home to the Birthplace of Country Music Museum.[21][22] Historians have also noted the influence of the less-known Johnson City sessions of 1928 and 1929,[23][24] and the Knoxville sessions of 1929 and 1930.[25] In addition, the Mountain City Fiddlers Convention, held in 1925, helped to inspire modern country music. Before these, pioneer settlers, in the Great Smoky Mountains region, had developed a rich musical heritage.[26] The first generation emerged in the 1920s, with Atlanta's music scene playing a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists. James Gideon \"Gid\" Tanner (1885–1960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the Skillet Lickers, was one of the most innovative and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were Clayton McMichen (fiddle and vocal), Dan Hornsby (vocals), Riley Puckett (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label Okeh Records began issuing hillbilly music records by Fiddlin' John Carson as early as 1923, followed by Columbia Records (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") (Samantha Bumgarner) in 1924, and RCA Victor Records in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre Jimmie Rodgers, who is widely considered the \"Father of Country Music\", and the first family of country music the Carter Family.[27] Many \"hillbilly\" musicians recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.[28] During the second generation (1930s–1940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring Gene Autry, who was known as king of the \"singing cowboys,\" and Hank Williams. Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a \"hot string band,\" and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as western swing. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.[29] Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\". The third generation (1950s–1960s) started at the end of World War II with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as bluegrass, which emerged when Bill Monroe, along with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, were introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. Gospel music remained a popular component of country music. The Native American, Hispano, and American frontier music of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, became popular among poor communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; the basic ensemble consisted of classical guitar, bass guitar, dobro or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured electric guitars, trumpets, keyboards (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of tack piano), banjos, and drums. By the early 1950s it blended with rock and roll, becoming the rockabilly sound produced by Sam Phillips, Norman Petty, and Bob Keane. Musicians like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly,", "<2-hop>\n\nJerry Lee Lewis, Ritchie Valens, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and Johnny Cash emerged as enduring representatives of the style. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee; Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the 1950s to the mid-1960s, western singer-songwriters such as Marty Robbins rose in prominence as did others, throughout western music traditions, like New Mexico music's Al Hurricane. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the British Invasion, many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as country rock. Fourth generation (1970s–1980s) music included outlaw country with roots in the Bakersfield sound, and country pop with roots in the countrypolitan, folk music and soft rock. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, Texas country and Tejano music gained popularity with performers like Freddie Fender. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production. During the fifth generation (the 1990s), neotraditionalists and stadium country acts prospered. The sixth generation (2000s–present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. It has also, however, seen a shift into patriotism and conservative politics since 9/11, though such themes are less prevalent in more modern trends.[30] The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were those by Lady A, Florida Georgia Line, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift.[31] Hip hop also made its mark on country music with the emergence of country rap.[32] The first commercial recordings of what was considered instrumental music in the traditional country style were \"Arkansas Traveler\" and \"Turkey in the Straw\" by fiddlers Henry Gilliland & A.C. (Eck) Robertson on June 30, 1922, for Victor Records and released in April 1923.[33][34] Columbia Records began issuing records with \"hillbilly\" music (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") as early as 1924.[27] The first commercial recording of what is widely considered to be the first country song featuring vocals and lyrics was Fiddlin' John Carson with \"Little Log Cabin in the Lane\" for Okeh Records on June 14, 1923.[35][36] Vernon Dalhart was the first country singer to have a nationwide hit in May 1924 with \"Wreck of the Old 97\".[37][38] The flip side of the record was \"Lonesome Road Blues\", which also became very popular.[39] In April 1924, \"Aunt\" Samantha Bumgarner and Eva Davis became the first female musicians to record and release country songs.[40] The record 129-D produced by Columbia features Samantha playing fiddle and singing Big-Eyed Rabbit while Eva Davis plays banjo. The other side features Eva Davis playing banjo while singing Wild Bill Jones. Many of the early country musicians, such as the yodeler Cliff Carlisle, recorded blues songs into the 1930s.[41] Other important early recording artists were Riley Puckett, Don Richardson, Fiddlin' John Carson, Uncle Dave Macon, Al Hopkins, Ernest V. Stoneman, Blind Alfred Reed, Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers and the Skillet Lickers.[42] The steel guitar entered country music as early as 1922, when Jimmie Tarlton met famed Hawaiian guitarist Frank Ferera on the West Coast.[43] Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family are widely considered to be important early country musicians. From Scott County, Virginia, the Carters had learned sight reading of hymnals and sheet music using solfege.[citation needed] Their songs were first captured at a historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee, on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and sound recordist.[44][45] A scene in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? depicts a similar occurrence in the same timeframe. Rodgers fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk, and many of his best songs were his compositions, including \"Blue Yodel\",[46] which sold over a million records and established Rodgers as the premier singer of early country music.[47][48] Beginning in 1927, and for the next 17 years, the Carters recorded some 300 old-time ballads, traditional tunes, country songs and gospel hymns, all representative of America's southeastern folklore and heritage.[49] Maybelle Carter went on to continue the family tradition with her daughters as The Carter Sisters; her daughter June would marry (in succession) Carl Smith, Rip Nix and Johnny Cash, having children with each who would also become country singers. Record sales declined during the Great Depression. However, radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started by radio stations all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day.[50] Some of the early stars on the Opry were Uncle Dave Macon, Roy Acuff and African American harmonica player DeFord Bailey. WSM's 50,000-watt signal (in 1934) could often be heard across the country.[51] Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. Moon Mullican, for example, played western swing but also recorded songs that can be called rockabilly. Between 1947 and 1949, country crooner Eddy Arnold placed eight songs in the top 10.[52] From 1945 to 1955 Jenny Lou Carson was one", "<3-hop>\n\nMendoza, Roy Rogers, and Patsy Montana. Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads, New Mexico, Texas country and Tejano music rhythms of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song \"El Paso\", first recorded by Marty Robbins in September 1959. Western music's influence would continue to grow within the country music sphere, western musicians like Michael Martin Murphey, New Mexico music artists Al Hurricane and Antonia Apodaca, Tejano music performer Little Joe, and even folk revivalist John Denver, all first rose to prominence during this time. This western music influence largely kept the music of the folk revival and folk rock from influencing the country music genre much, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, the Byrds' negative reception during their appearance on the Grand Ole Opry). The main concern was largely political: most folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. John Denver was perhaps the only musician to have major success in both the country and folk revival genres throughout his career, later only a handful of artists like Burl Ives and Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot successfully made the crossover to country after folk revival fell out of fashion. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.[66] In 1953, the first all-country radio station was established in Lubbock, Texas.[67] The music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and truckers in particular. As country radio became more popular, trucking songs like the 1963 hit song Six Days on the Road by Dave Dudley began to make up their own subgenre of country. These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a \"new folk hero\", marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music. The song was written by actual truckers and contained numerous references to the trucker culture of the time like \"ICC\" for Interstate Commerce Commission and \"little white pills\" as a reference to amphetamines. Starday Records in Nashville followed up on Dudley's initial success with the release of Give Me 40 Acres by the Willis Brothers.[67] Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s; one of the first rock and roll superstars was former western yodeler Bill Haley, who repurposed his Four Aces of Western Swing into a rock and roll band in the early 1950s and renamed it the Comets. Bill Haley & His Comets are credited with two of the first successful rock and roll records, \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" of 1953 and \"Rock Around the Clock\" in 1954.[68] 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly in country music. Rockabilly was an early form of rock and roll, an upbeat combination of blues and country music.[69] The number two, three and four songs on Billboard's charts for that year were Elvis Presley, \"Heartbreak Hotel\"; Johnny Cash, \"I Walk the Line\"; and Carl Perkins, \"Blue Suede Shoes\". Reflecting this success, George Jones released a rockabilly record that year under the pseudonym \"Thumper Jones\", wanting to capitalize on the popularity of rockabilly without alienating his traditional country base.[70] Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 \"Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger\" by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley \"Don't/I Beg of You.\"[71] Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues artists and his style, saying \"The colored folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know.\" Within a few years, many rockabilly musicians returned to a more mainstream style or had defined their own unique style. Country music gained national television exposure through Ozark Jubilee on ABC-TV and radio from 1955 to 1960 from Springfield, Missouri. The program showcased top stars including several rockabilly artists, some from the Ozarks. As Webb Pierce put it in 1956, \"Once upon a time, it was almost impossible to sell country music in a place like New York City. Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else.\"[72] The Country Music Association was founded in 1958, in part because numerous country musicians were appalled by the increased influence of rock and roll on country music.[73] Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee. Under the direction of producers such as Chet Atkins, Bill Porter, Paul Cohen, Owen Bradley, Bob Ferguson, and later Billy Sherrill, the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period. This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a string section (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark \"licks\". Leading artists in this genre included Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, Connie Smith, the Browns,[74] Patsy Cline, and Eddy Arnold. The \"slip note\" piano style of session musician Floyd Cramer was an important component of this style.[75] The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the British Invasion and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into countrypolitan. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included Tammy Wynette, Lynn Anderson and Charlie Rich, as well as such former \"hard country\" artists as Ray Price and Marty Robbins. Despite the appeal of the Nashville sound, many traditional country artists emerged during this period and dominated the genre: Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, Porter Wagoner, George Jones, and Sonny James among them. In 1962, Ray Charles surprised the pop world by turning his attention to country and western"], "reference": "Beginning in the mid-1950s and peaking in the early 1960s, the Nashville Sound transformed country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville, Tennessee.

{"user_input": "What is free tekno music genre, and how does it differ from techno, also what are some of the subgenres that evolved from it, including tribe tek and how did tribe tek evolve?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nFree tekno, also known as tekno, freetekno and hardtek, is the music predominantly played at free parties in Europe. The spelling tekno is deliberately used to differentiate the musical style from techno. The music is fast and it can vary between 150 and 185 bpm and is characterised by a pounding repetitive kick drum.[1] Nevertheless, bass drum distortion by clipping is used less often as in the related genre of mainstyle hardcore. Nowadays, some tekno producers also use drum sets that rather sound trancey, since many members of the tekno subculture as well as the psytrance subculture frequently attend the same raves and the two scenes are closely connected. Tekk/Tekke is mainly produced in Germany and often remixes quotes or audio clips. As dance music, tekkno was unusually rhythm-oriented for the time.[2] Therefore, this term also became synonymous with particularly hard dance music.[2] At times, the number of the letter \"k\" was used to advertise the supposed hardness of the sound at parties and compilations (Tekno, Tekkno, Tekkkno...). A similar variant appeared shortly afterwards with the emergence of the Freetekno[de] scene. The overall sound of Tekk can be descripted as \"dumb\" or \"asozial/assi\", due to its heavy and monotone kicks with repeating vocals. Famous artists are: Die Gebrüder Brett, Zahni, Nogge, Crotekk, Minupren and Craig Mortalis. Tekno evolved in tandem with the teknival movement in the early 1990s since many of the teknival organisers and DJs were also making music. At first the music took off from acid house and then drew on influences such as hardcore, jungle, early hardcore and techno, with the producers taking the sound in a darker direction. Spiral Tribe was the first to start making and widely disseminating this genre, taking it to France and Eastern Europe after the Criminal Justice act was implemented in the UK. An emphasis is placed on samples from TV shows, films and popular culture which are placed at strategic moments in the tracks. The music was produced with whatever was available: drum machines, synthesisers and keyboards as well as computer programs such as audio/MIDI sequencers and Trackers, sometimes even hitting a random table with a pen. Starting from year 2001 there has been a trend using laptop and laptops for live performances, because the capabilities of both the hardware and software were improving very quickly. Many artists, however, still use hardware for live performance and create a unique track at every freeparty. The sounds are lot simpler making them sound more oldschool and easier to dance to. The main genre that is still played with hardware, is tribe, a relatively underground subgenre of tekno. With the evolution of the genre it has come to be known by a number of names, including spiral tekno, hardtek, tribetek, tribe and lately evolved in many other subgenres like pumping tek, hardfloor and Frenchcore which is a sort of mixture between mainstream hardcore and hardtekno, with funny and pumping samples taken from different media sources. Artists within this genre usually follow a very different ideology when compared to more modern and mainstream producers: This is described as \"returning to the roots\". Jungletek and raggatek are genres derived directly from hardtek. These genres are often mixed to create fast energetic 190 bpm dance floor music. Kicked off around 2008 in the UK, Mandidextrous & Vandal were among the first producers of these genres. It breathed new life into the underground rave scene not only in the UK but also picking up a strong following in Italy, Spain and Austria to mention a few. Influences for this music also came from the techno scene in Europe where some of the first underground music lovers increase the bpm and added variations in structure, thus becoming tekno. Techno in the UK in the early 1990s was based on a bpm of 130–140. By the 2000s, tekno had gained more speed and hardtek was starting to dominate UK raves, especially in the South and London. Trance also progressed from sweeping delicate melodies to what's now known as hard trance. Hard trance is a faster and bouncier music than its predecessor. In late 2010s, there was a progression of drum and bass (DnB) into neurofunk, which was grittier and had harsher bass and synth sounds. Raggatek is predominantly influenced by reggae and ragga, incorporating also elements from jungle, DnB, dancehall and techno. Well-known MCs such as YT and Top Cat are a massive influence on the world of raggatek. Producers loving this type of sound wanted to bring it to the dance floors of the underground. Upping the bpm to between 180 – 200 and adding breaks. The big sounding ragga style vocals are often present in raggatek songs. Jungletek works on exactly the same formula as raggatek, replacing the ragga elements with those from jungle and DnB. It is less known for the vocal arrangements and more for its bass lines. Jungletek takes the basics of the bass line from well-known jungle and DnB tracks and recreates them in a hardtek format. Original productions also use the simple format of kick-bass with amen breaks. European raggatek and jungletek are often recognizable by their energetic eletro sounds in the bass lines and synth melodies. Other subgenres include, acid tekno. Tracks usually include a simple hard hitting kick and acid lines as melodies. These acid lines appeared in the 1980s with acid house music. This particular and unique sound is produced with a synthesizer like the tb-303 by Roland. This subgenre eventually gave birth to acidcore, which is faster and has distorted kicks. Another subgenre that is played a lot at free parties is tribe tek. A simple kick bassline with simple rhythmic patterns on top of the kicks. This genre can be traced back all the way to the first parties where it was played on hardware, like synthesizers.

The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts was driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as album 1989 (2014), Reputation (2017), and Lover (2019) were released solely to pop audiences.[136][137][138] Swift returned to country music in her recent folk-inspired releases, Folklore (2020) and Evermore (2020), with songs like \"Betty\" and \"No Body, No Crime\". In the mid to late 2010s, country music began to increasingly sound more like the style of modern-day Pop music,[131] with more simple and repetitive lyrics, more electronic-based instrumentation, and experimentation with \"talk-singing\" and rap, pop-country pulled farther away from the traditional sounds of country music and received criticisms from country music purists while gaining in popularity with mainstream audiences.[139] The topics addressed have also changed, turning controversial such as acceptance of the LGBT community, safe sex, recreational marijuana use, and questioning religious sentiment.[132] Influences also come from some pop artists' interest in the country genre, including Justin Timberlake with the album Man of the Woods,[140] Beyoncé's song \"Daddy Lessons\" from Lemonade,[141] Kelly Clarkson,[134] Gwen Stefani with \"Nobody but You\",[142] Bruno Mars,[143] Lady Gaga,[144] Alicia Keys,[145] and Pink.[146] The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s as artists like Eric Church, Jason Aldean, and Brantley Gilbert have had success; Aaron Lewis, former frontman for the rock group Staind, had a moderately successful entry into country music in 2011 and 2012, as did Dallas Smith, former frontman of the band Default. Maren Morris success collaboration \"The Middle\" with EDM producer Zedd is considered one of the representations of the fusion of electro-pop with country music.[147] Lil Nas X song \"Old Town Road\" spent 19 weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the longest-running number-one song since the chart debuted in 1958, winning Billboard Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards and Grammy Award.[148] Sam Hunt \"Leave the Night On\" peaked concurrently on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, making Hunt the first country artist in 22 years, since Billy Ray Cyrus, to reach the top of three country charts simultaneously in the Nielsen SoundScan-era.[149] With the fusion genre of \"country trap\"—a fusion of country/western themes to a hip hop beat, but usually with fully sung lyrics—emerging in the late 2010s, line dancing country had a minor revival, examples of the phenomenon include \"The Git Up\" by Blanco Brown.[150] Blanco Brown has gone on to make more traditional country soul songs such as \"I Need Love\" and a rendition of \"Don't Take the Girl\" with Tim McGraw, and collaborations like \"Just the Way\" with Parmalee.[151] Another country trap artist known as Breland has seen success with \"My Truck, \"Throw It Back\" with Keith Urban, and \"Praise the Lord\" featuring Thomas Rhett.[152] Emo rap musician Sueco, released a cowpunk song in collaboration is country musician Warren Zeiders titled \"Ride It Hard\".[153] In the early 2010s, \"bro-country\", a genre noted primarily for its themes on drinking and partying, girls, and pickup trucks became particularly popular.[154][155][156] Notable artists associated with this genre are Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton, Jake Owen and Florida Georgia Line whose song \"Cruise\" became the best-selling country song of all time.[31][157] Research in the mid-2010s suggested that about 45 percent of country's best-selling songs could be considered bro-country, with the top two artists being Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line.[158] Albums by bro-country singers also sold very well—in 2013, Luke Bryan's Crash My Party was the third best-selling of all albums in the United States, with Florida Georgia Line's Here's to the Good Times at sixth, and Blake Shelton's Based on a True Story at ninth.[159] It is also thought that the popularity of bro-country helped country music to surpass classic rock as the most popular genre in the American country in 2012.[159] The genre however is controversial as it has been criticized by other country musicians and commentators over its themes and depiction of women,[160][161][162] opening up a divide between the older generation of country singers and the younger bro country singers that was described as \"civil war\" by musicians, critics, and journalists.\"[163] In 2014, Maddie & Tae's \"Girl in a Country Song\", addressing many of the controversial bro-country themes, peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart. Bluegrass is a genre that contain songs about going through hard times, country loving, and telling stories. Its history can be traced back to the 1600s. During this time, many people were coming to America from Ireland, Scotland and England.[164] Those people brought the first version of Bluegrass to the Americas. After several years of bluegrass' development, Bill Monroe became the \"father\" of bluegrass.[165] Other sources argue that The Monroe Brothers were the first stars of bluegrass.[166] Newer artists like Billy Strings, the Grascals, Molly Tuttle, Tyler Childers and the Infamous Stringdusters have been increasing the popularity of this genre, alongside some of the genres more established stars who still remain popular including Rhonda Vincent, Alison Krauss and Union Station, Ricky Skaggs and Del McCoury. The genre has developed in the Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati area. Other artists include New South (band), Doc Watson, Osborne Brothers, and many others. In an effort to combat the over-reliance of mainstream country music on pop-infused artists, the sister genre of Americana began to gain popularity and increase in prominence, receiving eight Grammy categories of its own in 2009. Though Americana music gained popularity in 2009, the first Americana singer was likely Hank Williams in the 1950s.[167] Americana music incorporates elements of country music, bluegrass, folk, blues,", "<2-hop>\n\nand the Billboard Hot 100.

Other rock stars who featured a country song on their albums were Don Henley (who released Cass County in 2015, an album which featured collaborations with numerous country artists) and Poison. The back half of the 2010–2020 decade saw an increasing number of mainstream country acts collaborate with pop and R&B acts; many of these songs achieved commercial success by appealing to fans across multiple genres; examples include collaborations between Kane Brown and Marshmello[128] and Maren Morris and Zedd.[129] There has also been interest from pop singers in country music, including Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Gwen Stefani, Justin Timberlake, Justin Bieber and Pink.[130] Supporting this movement is the new generation of contemporary pop-country, including Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Kacey Musgraves, Miley Cyrus, Billy Ray Cyrus, Sam Hunt, Chris Young,[131] who introduced new themes in their works, touching on fundamental rights, feminism, and controversies about racism and religion of the older generations.[132] In 2005, country singer Carrie Underwood rose to fame as the winner of the fourth season of American Idol; she has since become one of the most prominent recording artists in the genre, with worldwide sales of more than 65 million records and seven Grammy Awards.[133] With her first single, \"Inside Your Heaven\", Underwood became the only solo country artist to have a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the 2000–2009 decade and also broke Billboard chart history as the first country music artist ever to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by Billboard as the number 1 Country Album of the 2000–2009 decade. She has also become the female country artist with the most number one hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991–present), having 14 #1s and breaking her own Guinness Book record of ten. In 2007, Underwood won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards, and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. Time has listed Underwood as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2016, Underwood topped the Country Airplay chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with the most number ones on that chart. Carrie Underwood was only one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s. In addition to Underwood, American Idol launched the careers of Kellie Pickler, Josh Gracin, Bucky Covington, Kristy Lee Cook, Danny Gokey, Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery (as well as that of occasional country singer Kelly Clarkson[134]) in the decade, and would continue to launch country careers in the 2010s. The series Nashville Star, while not nearly as successful as Idol, did manage to bring Miranda Lambert, Kacey Musgraves and Chris Young to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as Buddy Jewell, Sean Patrick McGraw, and Canadian musician George Canyon. Can You Duet? produced the duos Steel Magnolia and Joey + Rory. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress Jennette McCurdy (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom iCarly) released her first single, \"So Close\", following that with the single \"Generation Love\" in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, Miley Cyrus (of Disney Channel's Hannah Montana), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with \"The Climb\" and another with a duet with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, with \"Ready, Set, Don't Go.\" Jana Kramer, an actress in the teen drama One Tree Hill, released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013. Actresses Hayden Panettiere and Connie Britton began recording country songs as part of their roles in the TV shows Nashville and Pretty Little Liars star Lucy Hale released her debut album Road Between in 2014. In 2010, the group Lady Antebellum won five Grammys, including the coveted Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Need You Now\".[135] A large number of duos and vocal groups emerged on the charts in the 2010s, many of which feature close harmony in the lead vocals. In addition to Lady A, groups such as Little Big Town, the Band Perry, Gloriana, Thompson Square, Eli Young Band, Zac Brown Band and British duo the Shires have emerged to occupy a large share of mainstream success alongside solo singers such as Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert. One of the most commercially successful country artists of the late 2000s and early 2010s has been singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, \"Tim McGraw\", was released when Swift was only 16 years old. In 2006, Swift released her self-titled debut studio album, which spent 275 weeks on Billboard 200, one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, Fearless, which made her the second longest number-one charted on Billboard 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind Adele's 21) within the past 5 years. At the 2010 Grammys, Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for Fearless, which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received fourteen Grammys already. Buoyed by her teen idol status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the Billboard charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's"], "reference": "Taylor Swift's 2012 single \\\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\\" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart and Hot Country Songs chart of any song in nearly five decades. However, its long run at the top was controversial because it's largely a pop song without much country influence. Its success was driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song. This occurred amidst a trend of increasing collaborations between mainstream country acts and pop artists, as well as interest from pop singers in country music, influencing the Billboard charts.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer"}

The Prodigy's song \"Smack My Bitch Up\" went to number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100.[23] The Fat of the Land by the Prodigy sold 2,600,000 copies in the United States[24] and was certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[25] The Prodigy's single \"Firestarter\" was certified gold by the RIAA.[26] Fatboy Slim also achieved international success in the 1990s. His 1998 album You've Come a Long Way, Baby was certified platinum in September 1999.[27] Fatboy Slim's song \"Praise You\" peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100 on May 22, 1999, and his song \"The Rockafeller Skank\" peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 on January 15, 2000.[28] \"Praise You\" and \"The Rockafeller Skank\" peaked at number 22 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart in 1999 and number 21 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart in 1999, respectively.[29] In August 1998, The Crystal Method's song \"Comin' Back\" reached number one on the Dance Club Songs chart.[30] The Chemical Brothers' 1997 album Dig Your Own Hole was certified gold by the RIAA[31] and sold over 750,000 copies in the United States.[32] The Chemical Brothers' song \"Setting Sun\" peaked at number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1997.[33] Their mainstream success helped Exit Planet Dust (1995) and Surrender (1999) sell 331,000 and 402,000 copies in the U.S., respectively.[34] Big beat also gained prominence in popular culture through its inclusion in major soundtracks. The platinum-certified soundtrack for The Matrix (1999) featured big beat tracks, selling over 1.4 million copies in the U.S.[35] The genre has also appeared in films such as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)[36] and in the Wipeout video game series by Psygnosis.[37] The original Wipeout (1995) and its sequels, Wipeout 2097 (released as Wipeout XL in the U.S.) and Wip3out, featured soundtracks with big beat artists such as The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, Propellerheads, and Fluke. This collaboration has been recognised as a pioneering example of cultural crossover between gaming and electronic music.[38][39][40] The big beat scene had started to gradually decline in popularity by 2001, due to the novelty of the genre's formula fading.[41] The genre's most successful acts would further change their sound; more prominently, the Chemical Brothers releasing more material with direct house and techno characteristics (including \"4x4\" beats which resemble those of house and synthesizer sweeps and noises, marking a departure from their big beat sound consisting of syncopated breakbeats and hip hop samples) inspired by the success of the Gatecrasher club and the trance movement, which would reach a commercial peak between 1999 and 2002. However, big beat had left an indelible mark on popular music as an indigenous progression from rave music, bridging a divide between clubbers and indie rock fans. Without this connection, some have reasoned that it would not have reached the heights that it did, or resonated with as many listeners as it did.[42]", "<2-hop>\n\nmusic, topping the charts and rating number three for the year on Billboard's pop chart[76] with the \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" single, and recording the landmark album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.[77] Another subgenre of country music grew out of hardcore honky tonk with elements of western swing and originated 112 miles (180 km) north-northwest of Los Angeles in Bakersfield, California, where many \"Okies\" and other Dust Bowl migrants had settled. Influenced by one-time West Coast residents Bob Wills and Lefty Frizzell, by 1966 it was known as the Bakersfield sound. It relied on electric instruments and amplification, in particular the Telecaster electric guitar, more than other subgenres of the country music of the era, and it can be described as having a sharp, hard, driving, no-frills, edgy flavor—hard guitars and honky-tonk harmonies.[67] Leading practitioners of this style were Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, Tommy Collins, Dwight Yoakam, Gary Allan, and Wynn Stewart, each of whom had his own style.[78][79] Ken Nelson, who had produced Owens and Haggard and Rose Maddox became interested in the trucking song subgenre following the success of Six Days on the Road and asked Red Simpson to record an album of trucking songs. Haggard's White Line Fever was also part of the trucking subgenre.[67] The country music scene of the 1940s until the 1970s was largely dominated by western music influences, so much so that the genre began to be called \"country and western\".[80] Even today, cowboy and frontier values continue to play a role in the larger country music, with western wear, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats continues to be in fashion for country artists.[81] West of the Mississippi River, many of these western genres continue to flourish, including the Red Dirt of Oklahoma,[82] New Mexico music of New Mexico,[83] and both Texas country music and Tejano music of Texas.[84][85] During the 1950s until the early 1970s, the latter part of the western heyday in country music, many of these genres featured popular artists that continue to influence both their distinctive genres and larger country music. Red Dirt featured Bob Childers and Steve Ripley; for New Mexico music Al Hurricane, Al Hurricane Jr., and Antonia Apodaca; and within the Texas scenes Willie Nelson, Freddie Fender, Johnny Rodriguez, and Little Joe. As Outlaw country music emerged as subgenre in its own right, Red Dirt, New Mexico, Texas country, and Tejano grew in popularity as a part of the Outlaw country movement. Originating in the bars, fiestas, and honky-tonks of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas, their music supplemented outlaw country's singer-songwriter tradition as well as 21st-century rock-inspired alternative country and hip hop-inspired country rap artists.[86] Outlaw country was derived from the traditional western, including Red Dirt, New Mexico, Texas country, Tejano, and honky-tonk musical styles of the late 1950s and 1960s. Songs such as the 1963 Johnny Cash popularized \"Ring of Fire\" show clear influences from the likes of Al Hurricane and Little Joe, this influence just happened to culminate with artists such as Ray Price (whose band, the \"Cherokee Cowboys\", included Willie Nelson and Roger Miller) and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period, a collection of musicians that came to be known as the outlaw movement revolutionized the genre of country music in the early 1970s.[87][88] \"After I left Nashville (the early 70s), I wanted to relax and play the music that I wanted to play, and just stay around Texas, maybe Oklahoma. Waylon and I had that outlaw image going, and when it caught on at colleges and we started selling records, we were O.K. The whole outlaw thing, it had nothing to do with the music, it was something that got written in an article, and the young people said, 'Well, that's pretty cool.' And started listening.\" (Willie Nelson)[89] The term outlaw country is traditionally associated with Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker,[90] Hank Williams, Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings and Joe Ely.[91] It was encapsulated in the 1976 album Wanted! The Outlaws. Though the outlaw movement as a cultural fad had died down after the late 1970s (with Jennings noting in 1978 that it had gotten out of hand and led to real-life legal scrutiny), many western and outlaw country music artists maintained their popularity during the 1980s by forming supergroups, such as The Highwaymen,[92] Texas Tornados,[93] and Bandido.[94] Country pop or soft pop, with roots in the countrypolitan sound, folk music, and soft rock, is a subgenre that first emerged in the 1970s. Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to adult contemporary music. It started with pop music singers like Glen Campbell, Bobbie Gentry, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, Anne Murray, B. J. Thomas, the Bellamy Brothers, and Linda Ronstadt having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"Rocky Mountain High\", \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\", \"Annie's Song\", \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\", and \"I'm Sorry\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Jean Shepard and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement. During the mid-1970s, Dolly Parton, a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"Here You Come Again\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the"], "reference": "The Prodigy's song \"Firestarter\" went to number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Smack My Bitch Up\" reached number 89.

However, the sound tended to be more house and the rap-oriented artists received airplay. For instance, the German hip-house project Snap!, the Belgian hip-house project Technotronic and the Dutch techno dance project L.A. Style received quite a bit of airplay early on.[101] The more Hi-NRG-oriented artists were typically played only during special \"mix\" shows, and it was often necessary to go to a club to hear Eurodance music. While Eurodance did become popular with club DJs in the United States, radio stations were cautious about playing anything that sounded too much like disco during most of the 1980s and 1990s. By the end of the 1990s, however, some of the later acts such as Italian group Eiffel 65 and Danish group Aqua did receive extensive airplay. Despite lack of widespread radio play, many Hi-NRG and Eurodance songs are popular at professional sporting events in the United States, especially ice hockey and basketball.[102][103] Compilation albums, such as the DMA Dance: Eurodance series of compilation albums (1995–1997) from Interhit Records and Dance Music Authority magazine, were popular and helped to define the genre as well as to make it accessible in the U.S. and Canada.[104] Hands up (also known as handz up! (stylized as HandzUp!) or dancecore in Eastern Europe) is a style of trance music, and a derivation of Eurodance. The genre comes from its name, meaning music that requires listeners to \"put their hands up\", as well as fitness and danceability. The genre developed in Germany in the mid- to late 1990s as part of the emerging trance music scene. Representatives of Eurodance such as Starsplash and Mark 'Oh are sometimes regarded as forerunners of hands up. The biggest commercial success was the music until the mid-2000s.[clarification needed] The synthesizer melodies are often catchy and simple. Often the vocal melody is accompanied by a synthesizer. In contrast to techno, short, high-pitched synthesizer tones are used. Hands up does not rely on the structure of tension build-up, but rather is based on the typical verse-chorus pop music scheme. The main elements are the bassline, drums and a catchy lead sound. A typical stylistic device of hands up is pitched female or resulting feminine vocals, but male vocals are also common. In addition, distorted, autotuned, chopped and repeated spoken phrases are common characteristics. DJs & groups such as Manian, Rob Mayth, Rocco & Bass-T, DJ Gollum, Scooter, ItaloBrothers, Klubbingman, Discotronic, Ma.Bra., and Megastylez etc. are representative figures of this subgenre in both Germany and around the world."], "reference": "Beyoncé's 2024 album Cowboy Carter was conceptualized as a journey through a reinvention of Americana, spotlighting the overlooked contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history.

{"user_input": "Given Bob Wills' significant influence on Western swing and the integration of drums into his Texas Playboys, how did his pioneering work, particularly his blend of country and jazz, influence the development of subgenres like honky-tonk and the later emergence of outlaw country, considering the initial resistance to drums in traditional country music and the eventual acceptance of electric instruments?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nof the most prolific songwriters in country music.[53] In the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Some of the popular singing cowboys from the era were Gene Autry, the Sons of the Pioneers, and Roy Rogers.[54] Country music and western music were frequently played together on the same radio stations, hence the term country and western music, despite country and western being two distinct genres. Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. Patsy Montana opened the door for female artists with her history-making song \"I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\". This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a \"hot string band,\" and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started out as dance hall music, would become known as western swing. Cliff Bruner, Moon Mullican, Milton Brown and Adolph Hofner were other early western swing pioneers. Spade Cooley and Tex Williams also had very popular bands and appeared in films. At its height, western swing rivaled the popularity of big band swing music. Drums were scorned by early country musicians as being \"too loud\" and \"not pure\", but by 1935 western swing big band leader Bob Wills had added drums to the Texas Playboys. In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand-Ole-Opry Louisiana Hayride kept its infrequently used drummer backstage as late as 1956. By the early 1960s, however, it was rare for a country band not to have a drummer.[55] Bob Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.[29] A decade later (1948) Arthur Smith achieved top 10 US country chart success with his MGM Records recording of \"Guitar Boogie\", which crossed over to the US pop chart, introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar. For several decades Nashville session players preferred the warm tones of the Gibson and Gretsch archtop electrics, but a \"hot\" Fender style, using guitars which became available beginning in the early 1950s, eventually prevailed as the signature guitar sound of country.[55][56] Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when Johnny Barfield recorded \"Boogie Woogie\". The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning in late 1945. One notable release from this period was the Delmore Brothers' \"Freight Train Boogie\", considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards rockabilly. In 1948, Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith achieved top ten US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of \"Guitar Boogie\" and \"Banjo Boogie\", with the former crossing over to the US pop charts.[57] Other country boogie artists included Moon Mullican, Merrill Moore and Tennessee Ernie Ford. The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s and remains one of many subgenres of country into the 21st century. By the end of World War II, \"mountaineer\" string band music known as bluegrass had emerged when Bill Monroe joined with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. That was the ordination of bluegrass music and how Bill Monroe came to be known as the \"Father of Bluegrass.\" Gospel music, too, remained a popular component of bluegrass and other sorts of country music. Red Foley, the biggest country star following World War II, had one of the first million-selling gospel hits (\"Peace in the Valley\") and also sang boogie, blues and rockabilly. In the post-war period, country music was called \"folk\" in the trades, and \"hillbilly\" within the industry.[58] In 1944, Billboard replaced the term \"hillbilly\" with \"folk songs and blues,\" and switched to \"country and western\" in 1949.[59][60] Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among rural residents in the three states of Texhomex, those being Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.[61] It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly New Mexico and Texas,[62] together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as \"a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white ... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey.\"[63] East Texan Al Dexter had a hit with \"Honky Tonk Blues\", and seven years later \"Pistol Packin' Mama\".[64] These \"honky tonk\" songs were associated with barrooms, and was performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams; the music of these artists would later be called \"traditional\" country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll,[65] such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones. Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.

Though the outlaw movement as a cultural fad had died down after the late 1970s (with Jennings noting in 1978 that it had gotten out of hand and led to real-life legal scrutiny), many western and outlaw country music artists maintained their popularity during the 1980s by forming supergroups, such as The Highwaymen,[92] Texas Tornados,[93] and Bandido.[94] Country pop or soft pop, with roots in the countrypolitan sound, folk music, and soft rock, is a subgenre that first emerged in the 1970s. Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to adult contemporary music. It started with pop music singers like Glen Campbell, Bobbie Gentry, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, Anne Murray, B. J. Thomas, the Bellamy Brothers, and Linda Ronstadt having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"Rocky Mountain High\", \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\", \"Annie's Song\", \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\", and \"I'm Sorry\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Jean Shepard and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement. During the mid-1970s, Dolly Parton, a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"Here You Come Again\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the"], "reference": "Bob Wills, a country musician from the Lower Great Plains, gained popularity as the leader of a \"hot string band\" and appeared in Hollywood westerns. His mix of country and jazz, which started as dance hall music, became known as western swing. Wills was one of the first country musicians to add drums to his band, the Texas Playboys, around 1935, despite early country musicians scorning drums as \"too loud\" and \"not pure.\" His pioneering work, along with other western swing artists, influenced the development of honky-tonk, which had roots in western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states. Later, the outlaw country movement emerged, drawing from traditional western styles, including honky-tonk, and artists like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings further popularized this subgenre. The Bakersfield sound, another subgenre, also showed influence from Bob Wills and Lefty Frizzell, relying on electric instruments and amplification, particularly the Telecaster electric guitar.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer"}
