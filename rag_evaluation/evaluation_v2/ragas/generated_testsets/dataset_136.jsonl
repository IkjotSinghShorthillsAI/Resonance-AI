{"user_input": "Who is Ron Hardy in the context of acid house?", "reference_contexts": ["Psychedelic film Acid house (also simply known as just \"acid\") is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. The style is defined primarily by the squelching sounds and basslines of the Roland TB-303 electronic bass synthesizer-sequencer,[1] an innovation attributed to Chicago artists Phuture and Sleezy D circa 1986. Acid house soon became popular in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles. Acid house brought house music to a worldwide audience.[3] The influence of acid house can be heard in later styles of dance music including trance, hardcore, jungle, big beat, techno and trip hop.[4][5] Acid house's minimalist sound combined house music's ubiquitous programmed four-on-the-floor 4/4 beat with the electronic squelch sound produced by the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. The sound is commonly produced by raising the filter resonance and lowering the cutoff frequency of the synthesizer, along with programming the 303's accent, slide, and octave parameters, to create variation in otherwise simple bass patterns.[6] \"Exploration of texture\" is preferred over melody; \"a refusal of the metaphysical priorities of western music discourse\".[7] Other elements, such as synthetic strings and stabs, were usually minimal. Sometimes tracks were instrumentals, such as Phuture's \"Acid Tracks\", or contained full vocal performances, such as DJ Pierre's Pfantasy Club's \"Fantasy Girl\", while others were essentially instrumentals complemented by the odd spoken word \"drop-in\", such as Phuture's \"Slam\".[3] There are conflicting accounts about the origin of the term acid. One self-claimed account by members of Phuture points to their own \"Acid Tracks\". Before the song was given a title for commercial release, it was played by DJ Ron Hardy at a nightclub[8] where psychedelic drugs were reportedly used.[9] The club's patrons called the song \"Ron Hardy's Acid Track\" (or \"Ron Hardy's Acid Trax\").[8] The song was released with the title \"Acid Tracks\" on Larry Sherman's label Trax Records in 1987. Sources differ on whether it was Phuture or Sherman who chose the title; Phuture's DJ Pierre says the group did because the song was already known by that title,[8] but DJ Pierre says he chose the title because the song reminded him of acid rock.[10] Regardless, after the release of Phuture's song, the term acid house came into common parlance.[8] Another claim is that Psychic TV's frontperson Genesis Breyer P-Orridge actually named the genre.[11] Some accounts say the reference to \"acid\" may be a celebratory reference to psychedelic drugs in general, such as LSD, as well as the popular club drug Ecstasy (MDMA).[12] According to Professor Hillegonda Rietveld, a researcher specializing in electronic dance music, it was the house sensibility of Chicago, in a club like Hardy's The Music Box, that afforded it its initial meaning. In her view \"acid connotes the fragmentation of experience and dislocation of meaning due to the unstructuring effects on thought patterns which the psychedelic drug LSD or 'Acid' can bring about\".[13] In the context of the creation of \"Acid Tracks\" it indicated a concept rather than the use of psychedelic drugs in itself.[14] Some accounts disavow psychedelic connotations. One theory, holding that acid was a derogatory reference towards the use of samples in acid house music, was repeated in the press and in the British House of Commons.[15] In this theory, the term acid came from the slang term \"acid burning\", which the Oxford Dictionary of New Words calls \"a term for stealing\".[12][16] In 1991, UK Libertarian advocate Paul Staines claimed that he had coined this theory to discourage the government from adopting anti-rave party legislation.[17][18] The name of acid jazz is derived from that of acid house, which served as one of the inspirations for the genre's development.[19] Before the term \"acid house\" was introduced, rawer early acid house was \"hi-NRG\",[20] a type of bassline-driven electronic music that began with disco music that discarded its funk element, starting with Giorgio Moroder productions for Donna Summer. However, the earliest recorded examples of acid house are a matter of debate. Sleezy D's \"I've Lost Control\" (1986) was the first to be released on vinyl, but it is impossible to know which track was created first.[21] In the 21st century, attention was drawn to Charanjit Singh's album Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat, featuring Indian ragas fused with disco.[22][23] The album released as early as 1982, featured a TB-303 prominently, Singh being one of the earliest musicians to use it on a commercial release.[23] The record predates the famously known \"Acid Trax\" by 5 years. It was initially a commercial failure in India and eventually forgotten. Following its rediscovery and eventual re-release in early 2010 some music journalists compared the music to that of acid house music, even suggesting it might be the first example of the style.[22][23][24] Suns of Arqa's Ark of the Arqans (1985) proved an influence on early acid house.[25] The first acid house records were produced in Chicago, Illinois. Phuture, a group founded by Nathan \"DJ Pierre\" Jones, Earl \"Spanky\" Smith Jr., and Herbert \"Herb J\" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in house music (the instrument had been used earlier in disco records by the earlier mentioned Charanjit Singh in 1982,[26][27] in hi-NRG,[28] Alexander Robotnick in 1983).[29] The group's 12-minute \"Acid Tracks\" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably.[30] Chicago's house music scene suffered a crackdown on parties and events by the police. Sales of house records dwindled and, by 1988, the genre was selling less than a tenth as many records as at the height of the style's popularity.[31] However, house and especially acid house was beginning to experience a surge in popularity in Britain.[32] London's club Shoom opened in"], "reference": "Before Phuture's \"Acid Tracks\" was commercially released, DJ Ron Hardy played it at a nightclub.

It was opened by Danny Rampling and his wife, Jenny. The club was extremely exclusive and featured thick fog, a dreamy atmosphere and acid house.[34] This period began what some call the Second Summer of Love, a movement credited with a reduction in football hooliganism: instead of fights, football fans were listening to music, taking ecstasy, and joining the other club attendees in a peaceful movement that has been compared to the Summer of Love in San Francisco in 1967.[35] Another club called Trip was opened in June 1988 by Nicky Holloway at the Astoria in London's West End.[36] Trip was geared directly towards the acid house music scene. It was known for its intensity and stayed open until 3 AM. The patrons would spill into the streets chanting and drew the police on regular occasions. The reputation that occurrences like this created along with the UK's strong anti-club laws started to make it increasingly difficult to offer events in the conventional club atmosphere. Considered illegal in London during the late '80s, after-hour clubbing was against the law. However, this did not stop the club-goers from continuing after-hours dancing. Police raided the after-hour parties, so the groups began to assemble inside warehouses and other inconspicuous venues in secret, hence also marking the first developments of the rave.[37] Raves were well attended at this time and consisted of single events or moving series of parties thrown by production companies or unlicensed clubs. Two well-known groups at this point were Sunrise, who held particularly massive outdoor events, and Revolution in Progress (RIP), known for the dark atmosphere and hard music at events which were usually thrown in warehouses[37] or at Clink Street, a South East London nightclub housed in a former jail. Promoters like (The Big Lad) Shane McKenzie and the gang back in 1987 were doing small parties in NW London, moving raves from the streets and the fields to the clubs of London 1990–2005 which saw the future of raves in clubs all over the UK and Spain.[38] The Sunrise group threw several large acid house raves in Britain which gathered serious press attention. In 1988 they threw \"Burn It Up\", 1989 brought \"Early Summer Madness\", \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"Back to the Future\". They advertised huge sound systems, fairground rides, foreign DJs, and other attractions. Many articles were written sensationalizing these parties and the results of them, focusing especially on the drug use and out-of-control nature that the media perceived.[39] Once the term acid house became more widely used, participants at acid house-themed events in the UK and Ibiza made the psychedelic drug connotations a reality by using club drugs such as ecstasy and LSD.[38][40][41] The association of acid house, MDMA, and smiley faces was observed in New York City by late 1988.[42] This coincided with an increasing level of scrutiny and sensationalism in the mainstream press,[43] although conflicting accounts about the degree of connection between acid house music and drugs continued to surface.[44] Acid house was also popular in Manchester. The Thunderdome (which was generally advertised as a techno night) in Miles Platting was at the epicenter of the scene and gave rise to acts like A Guy Called Gerald, 808 State, Jam MC's, Steve Williams and Jay Wearden. A Greater Manchester-based producer called Peter Ford teamed up with Richard Salt and recorded a record called \"Oochy Koochy\", regarded as the first British acid house track. Released by dance indie Rhythm King Records as \"Oochy Koochy (FU Baby Yeah Yeah)\" under the name Baby Ford, the record peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart on September 24, 1988, and was followed by Baby Ford's \"Chikki Chikki Ahh Ahh\" hit.[45][46][47][48][49][50][51] The genre was extremely popular with the city's football hooligans. According to Manchester United football hooligan Colin Blaney in Hotshot: The Story of a Little Red Devil, the acid house venues were the only place where rival hooligan gangs would mix, without coming to blows with one another.[52] The Madchester and baggy movements saw acid house influences bleed into the Mancunian rock scene.

In hip-hop it comes on the fourth. Coming off the third beat comes from afrobeats.\"[9] Martin Connor, an expert in vocal melodies and rap analysis, described the characteristics of the genre as being \"[..] technically in 4/4, what you will hear over and over again is this recurring pattern made up of three notes that are still repeated in the framework of a 4/4 time signature [..] You can hear the inspirations of Jamaican music in the rhythm except Jamaican music doesn’t have a bass kick and the snare – that’s hip hop, that’s traditional rap. So this is that translation of cultures happening subtly in the instrumentation. Yet it still has a hip hop sensibility in terms of lyrical focus and music videos: cars, money, authenticity, hardness\".[1] The rise of afroswing is in large part a result of the slow acceptance of African-derived sounds in the UK. The first genre to really embrace African influenced music and push it into the mainstream was UK funky via artists such as Donae'o,[10][11] and in early-2010s, afrobeats, with artists such as Mista Silva, Kwamz, Fuse ODG, and Timbo gaining mainstream success through their afrobeats sound.[4][6][12] Around the same time, artists such as Sneakbo and Timbo were incorporating melodic rap and Caribbean influences into their music. These artists collectively set the foundation for what would later turn into afroswing,[13] and contributed to the rise of youth embracing their African heritage.[10][14][15] In 2010, Sneakbo released \"Touch Ah Button\", an early example of the merger of dancehall and afrobeats influences. In February 2014, Timbo and Mover released \"Ringtone\", which DJ Kenny Allstar credited as opening \"the door to the bridge of Afro-rap and the evolution of Afroswing, which was essentially someone laying a hook over a rap record\".[13] The rise of producers Jae5, Blairy Hendrix, Joshua Beatz, and rapper J Hus saw the sound begin to distinguish and cement itself.[4][14][16] Together they fused afrobeats, bashment, and trap, along with a melodic style of rapping with gritty, hood lyrical themes derivative of road rap.[17] J Hus and Timbo have both received credit for pioneering the genre.[7][18][13][19] Due to being a new genre, there was some confusion on what to call it initially.[4] This has led to many people calling the genre 'afrobeats', and whilst there are some similarities, the genre is not quite the same.[1] There also appeared to be cases of the genre having been briefly referred to as almost identical French 'afro trap'.[2][4][20][8] Likewise, simply lumping it up with \"UK rap\" is misleading, because while it is accurate, it disregards the uniqueness of the genre that sets it apart from other strands of UK rap.[21] Kojo Funds has explicitly stated he is not trying to be defined as an afrobeats artist and to instead refer to his music as afroswing.[22] Blairy Hendrix and Joshua Beatz, producers for J Hus, were in 2014 initially calling their sound \"Traprobeats\", denoting the various influences of afrobeats and trap music.[14] Around the same time, Jabz Daniels was making a similar sound and called his music \"Trapfrobeat\".[23] The name \"Afroswing\" was initially coined by rapper Kojo Funds, as well as being pushed by prominent producer Juls.[1][5][24] The name was derived from \"afro\", which in context and quoted by Funds, attributed to African music, with the mixture of drums derived from R&B and dancehall which the genre \"swings\" between using.[1] Afroswing was eventually picked up by Apple Music as their official genre name for the sound.[25] Spotify however, opted to go for \"AfroBashment\", a term coined by Austin Daboh who was hired by BBC 1Xtra, denoting its fusion of bashment and afrobeats styles.[15] In 2014, J Hus did a popular freestyle on YouTube channel GRM Daily showcasing his distinctive style.[12] The first notable song in the genre was released in 2015, titled \"Dem Boy Paigon\", quickly elevating J Hus' status and becoming a club hit, and soon after ushering in a new wave of artists making similar music.[4][12][14] J Hus' sound was a unique blend of Ghanaian afro-pop, afrobeats, and British rap. J Hus was unique in that he would mix rapping with melodic singing, something uncommon in the scene at the time.[12] 2014 also saw the emergence of MoStack, Tion Wayne, and Geko.[26] Many new artists began to crop up from 2015 onwards, such as Kojo Funds, Not3s, Don EE, and ZieZie.[26] Kojo Funds, who coined the name 'afroswing', made his break-out single \"Dun Talkin'\" alongside Abra Cadabra in 2016.[22] Lotto Boyzz, a Birmingham-based group, also gained prominence and decided to call their sound 'afrobbean', denoting the fusion of African and Caribbean influences in the sound.[27][28] The genre has been supported by YouTube channels such as GRM Daily, Link Up TV, and Mixtape Madness, which has allowed artists to easily release music videos to potentially millions of listeners and propagate the genre as a result.[4][12][17] Many afroswing artists, such as J Hus, Not3s, EO, and Ramz, have all had very successful singles in the charts, becoming mainstream acts in their own right.[7] Ramz' single \"Barking\" peaked at number 2 on the UK singles chart, and sold over 500,000 copies.[1] EO's song \"German\" peaked at number 13,[1][29] and J Hus' single \"Did You See\" got to number 9 on the charts and became the most-streamed single of 2017.[1] Another major artist in the genre, Kojo Funds, gained a \"Best Song"], "reference": "In the early-2010s, afrobeats artists such as Mista Silva, Kwamz, Fuse ODG, and Timbo gained mainstream success through their afrobeats sound.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "Considering my expertise in regional electronic music and the evolution of genres, can you elaborate on the specific ways in which British musical elements, such as those found in grime or UK funky, have influenced the development and characteristics of Afroswing, particularly in terms of its instrumentation, lyrical focus, and overall sound, as well as how the British charts have been impacted?", "reference_contexts": ["Afroswing, also known as Afrobashment, or less commonly Afrobbean or Afrowave,[1][2][3] is a genre of music that developed in the UK during the mid-2010s, derivative of dancehall and afrobeats, with influences from trap, British hip hop, R&B, and grime.[4][5][1][6] Commercially, the genre has been very successful, with many afroswing artists making it into the British charts.[1][7][4][8] Afroswing is largely defined by its melody rather than a specific tempo.[4] Producer Steel Banglez stated the key elements of afroswing were happy or dark chords that \"make you feel a certain way\", and that \"drum pattern is the most important thing about this whole sound, it's the snare that comes on the third. In hip-hop it comes on the fourth. Coming off the third beat comes from afrobeats.\"[9] Martin Connor, an expert in vocal melodies and rap analysis, described the characteristics of the genre as being \"[..] technically in 4/4, what you will hear over and over again is this recurring pattern made up of three notes that are still repeated in the framework of a 4/4 time signature [..] You can hear the inspirations of Jamaican music in the rhythm except Jamaican music doesn’t have a bass kick and the snare – that’s hip hop, that’s traditional rap. So this is that translation of cultures happening subtly in the instrumentation. Yet it still has a hip hop sensibility in terms of lyrical focus and music videos: cars, money, authenticity, hardness\".[1] The rise of afroswing is in large part a result of the slow acceptance of African-derived sounds in the UK.
