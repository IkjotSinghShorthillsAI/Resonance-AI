Vocal incidental music, which is included in the classical scores mentioned above, should never be confused with the score of a Broadway or film musical, in which the songs often reveal character and further the storyline. Vocal incidental music sets the tone for a film through using various beats or sounds, portraying the emotions of certain scenes.[9] Since the score of a Broadway or film musical is what actually makes the work a musical, it is far more essential to the work than mere incidental music, which nearly always amounts to little more than a background score; indeed, many plays have no incidental music whatsoever, allowing the actors to express their characters solely through words and their expressions.[10] The term furniture music was coined by Erik Satie in 1917, and demonstrated by him in three sets of compositions: Musique d'ameublement (1917), Sons industriels (1920) and Tenture de cabinet préfectoral (1923).

I know Detroit was important, but how did Philadelphia soul influence the development of progressive house, especially considering my focus on regional electronic music genres?", "reference_contexts": ["Progressive house is a subgenre of house music that emerged in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its evolving, melodic structures, subtle transitions, and layered sound design.[1][2] Initially rooted in a deeper underground sound, progressive house evolved to gain mainstream appeal by the 2010s, blending with festival styles and incorporating anthemic elements, leading to broader interpretations.[3][4][5] In the context of popular music the word \"progressive\" was first used widely in the 1970s to differentiate experimental forms of rock music from mainstream styles. Such music attempted to explore alternate approaches to rock music production.[6] In disco music, and later house music, a similar desire to separate more exploratory styles from standard approaches saw DJs and producers adopting the word \"progressive\" to make a distinction.[citation needed] According to DJ and producer Carl Craig, the term \"progressive\" was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italo disco. The music was dubbed \"progressive\" because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic sound of Philadelphia soul. In Detroit, prior to the emergence of techno, artists like Alexander Robotnick, Klein + M.B.O. and Capricorn filled a vacancy left after disco's demise in America.[7][8] In the late 1980s, UK music journalist Simon Reynolds introduced the term \"progressive dance\" to describe acts such as 808 State, The Orb, Bomb the Bass and The Shamen. Between 1990 and 1992, the term \"progressive\" referred to the short-form buzz word for the house music subgenre \"progressive house\".[9] Progressive house emerged after the first wave of house music.[10] The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom.[11] The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots. In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a \"new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house.\" A combination of US house, UK house, Italian house, and techno largely influenced one another during this era.[9] In June 1992, Mixmag published a list that contained what the magazine viewed as the top progressive house tracks at that time.[9] According to American DJ/producer duo Gabriel & Dresden, Leftfield's October 1990 release \"Not Forgotten\" was possibly the first progressive house production. The record label Guerilla Records, set up by William Orbit & Dick O'Dell, is thought to have been pivotal in the growth of a scene around the genre.[12] The 1994 Renaissance: The Mix Collection, mixed by Sasha and John Digweed, and Northern Exposure in 1996 have both been credited with establishing the genre, helping to define its sound and structure. As well as Guerilla Records, the labels Deconstruction Records, Hooj Choons and Soma Records contributed to the scene's development in the early to mid 1990s.[11] Among its derivative genres, progressive breaks emerged in the late 1990s as a subgenre of breaks. In the early 2000s, progressive house evolved by incorporating elements from deep house, tech house, and progressive trance. Pioneering artists such as Sasha, John Digweed, Hernán Cattáneo, and Sander Kleinenberg were instrumental in shaping its sound. This period also saw a convergence with the progressive trance movement, as artists like Deep Dish and Nick Warren infused more ethereal and cinematic elements into their productions.[3] In contrast to this trend, dark progressive house emerged as a deep, hypnotic and atmospheric variant of the genre.[13] By the 2010s, the term \"progressive house\" had broadened significantly, often diverging from its original underground meaning to a more mainstream and festival-oriented productions. This shift was reinforced by electronic music (EDM) charts and industry rankings, particularly DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs list[14] and digital platforms like Beatport,[15] which categorized a wide range of commercially successful tracks under the \"progressive house\" label. As a result, the genre's definition became increasingly ambiguous, with some artists and fans distinguishing between two distinct styles: the classic progressive house sound rooted in the 1990s and the more energetic, big room-influenced style that gained prominence in the 2010s.[3] This new style has been labeled with different terms such as mainstage progressive house,[16] festival progressive house,[17] and big room progressive house[18] to distinguish it from the original genre. During this period, the emerging style of progressive house gained widespread global popularity, thanks to artists such as Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, Alesso, Nicky Romero, and Martin Garrix. Avicii's 2011 hit \"Levels\" became one of the defining tracks of the era, blending uplifting melodies with festival-ready energy.[19] Similarly, Swedish House Mafia, the group composed by Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Steve Angello, propelled the genre further with \"Don't You Worry Child\" (2012),[20] an anthem that solidified progressive house's position in radio-friendly EDM. Swedish music labels Axtone, Refune, and Size played a pivotal role in defining the sound.[21] This era saw progressive house incorporating elements of big room house, a subgenre characterized by simplified structures, heavy drops, and grand, anthemic melodies, which take its roots in electro house. The fusion of these styles contributed to the commercial expansion of the genre, making it a staple at major EDM festivals worldwide.[4] Despite this shift, some artists remained committed to the original ethos, focusing on gradual builds, atmospheric textures, and intricate sound design. Eric Prydz[22] and Deadmau5, for instance, continued to refine and evolve the classic progressive house style, maintaining its connection to trance-influenced roots. \"Strobe\" by Deadmau5 is a good example, which had been cited by Billboard Dance as the artist's all-time best song.[23][24][5] In recent years, after the early 2010s commercial \"EDM boom\",[25] underground sounds have regained popularity. Labels like Anjunadeep, Lost & Found, and Sudbeat played a significant role in fostering this new wave of progressive house.

Developing from a combination of dance and pop with influences of disco,[3] post-disco[4] and synth-pop,[1] it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures[3] which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes.[3] The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.[3] Dance-pop is highly eclectic, having borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producers, artists and periods. Such include contemporary R&B, house, trance, techno, electropop, new jack swing, funk and pop rock. Dance-pop is a popular mainstream style of music and there have been numerous artists and groups who perform in the genre.

Dance-pop music emerged around the early 1980s as a combination of dance and pop, or post-disco, which was uptempo and simple, club-natured, producer-driven and catchy. Dance-pop was more uptempo and dancey than regular pop, yet more structured and less free-form than dance music, usually combining pop's easy structure and catchy tunes with dance's strong beat and uptempo nature. Dance-pop music was usually created, composed and produced by record producers who would then hire singers to perform the songs. At the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to mainstream pop. According to prominent AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna \"launched dance-pop\" and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades.[6] As the primary songwriter on her self-titled debut album and a co-producer by her third record, Madonna's insistence on being involved in all creative aspects of her work was highly unusual for a female dance-pop vocalist at the time. The staff of Vice magazine stated that her debut album \"drew the blueprint for future dance-pop.\"[7] In the 1980s, dance-pop was closely aligned to other uptempo electronic genres, such as Hi-NRG. Prominent producers in the 1980s included Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who created Hi-NRG/dance-pop for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Dead or Alive and Bananarama. During the decade, dance-pop borrowed influences from funk (e.g. Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston), new jack swing (e.g. Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul), and contemporary R&B. Other prominent dance-pop artists and groups of the 1980s included the Pet Shop Boys, Mel and Kim, Samantha Fox, Debbie Gibson, and Tiffany. By the 1990s, dance-pop had become a major genre in popular music. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the Spice Girls, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Backstreet Boys, and 'NSYNC. During the early 1990s, dance-pop borrowed influences from house music (e.g. Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy\", Taylor Dayne's Soul Dancing, and Madonna's \"Vogue\", \"Rescue Me\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\"), as well as contemporary R&B and new jack swing (e.g. Shanice's \"I Love Your Smile\"). By the late 1990s, electronic influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album Ray of Light (1998) incorporated techno, trance and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing electronica into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, Cher released a dance-pop song called \"Believe\" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, Auto-Tune. An audio processor and a form of pitch modification software, Auto-Tune is commonly used as a way to correct pitch and to create special effects. Since the late 1990s, the use of Auto-Tune processing has become a common feature of dance-pop music. Celine Dion also released a midtempo dance-pop song, \"That's the Way It Is\" by the end of 1999. Also during this period, some British bands connected with Britpop and alternative pop experimented with dance-pop as a form – examples include Catatonia single \"Karaoke Queen,\" Bis's top 40 hit \"Eurodisco\", Kenickie's final single \"Stay in the Sun\" and Romo band Orlando's major-label debut single \"Just For A Second.\" Another Britpop band, Theaudience was fronted by Sophie Ellis Bextor who went on to a successful solo career primarily in artist-driven dance-pop. At the beginning of the 2000s, dance-pop music was still prominent, and highly electronic in style, influenced by genres such as trance, house, techno and electro. Nonetheless, as R&B and hip hop became extremely popular from the early part of the decade onwards, dance-pop was often influenced by urban music. Dance-pop stars from the 1980s and 1990s such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Janet Jackson and Kylie Minogue continued to achieve success at the beginning of the decade. Whilst much dance-pop at the time was R&B-influenced, many records started to return to their disco roots; Kylie Minogue's albums such as Light Years (2000) and Fever (2001) contained influences of disco music, or a new 21st-century version of the genre known as nu-disco; hit singles such as \"Spinning Around\" (2000) and \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" (2001) also contained disco traces.[3] In Madonna's case, her album Music (2000) contained elements of Euro disco, especially the successful eponymous lead single.[8] Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-to-latter part of the decade when dance-pop music returned greatly to its disco roots; this"], "reference": "Background music is designed to affect behavioral and emotional responses, often played in public spaces at low volumes.

{"user_input": "How did the dark wave music genre emerge from new wave, and how does it compare to the evolution of progressive house music from its early 1990s UK roots to its later mainstream appeal?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nProgressive house is a subgenre of house music that emerged in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its evolving, melodic structures, subtle transitions, and layered sound design.[1][2] Initially rooted in a deeper underground sound, progressive house evolved to gain mainstream appeal by the 2010s, blending with festival styles and incorporating anthemic elements, leading to broader interpretations.[3][4][5] In the context of popular music the word \"progressive\" was first used widely in the 1970s to differentiate experimental forms of rock music from mainstream styles. Such music attempted to explore alternate approaches to rock music production.[6] In disco music, and later house music, a similar desire to separate more exploratory styles from standard approaches saw DJs and producers adopting the word \"progressive\" to make a distinction.[citation needed] According to DJ and producer Carl Craig, the term \"progressive\" was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italo disco. The music was dubbed \"progressive\" because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic sound of Philadelphia soul. In Detroit, prior to the emergence of techno, artists like Alexander Robotnick, Klein + M.B.O. and Capricorn filled a vacancy left after disco's demise in America.[7][8] In the late 1980s, UK music journalist Simon Reynolds introduced the term \"progressive dance\" to describe acts such as 808 State, The Orb, Bomb the Bass and The Shamen. Between 1990 and 1992, the term \"progressive\" referred to the short-form buzz word for the house music subgenre \"progressive house\".[9] Progressive house emerged after the first wave of house music.[10] The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom.[11] The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots. In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a \"new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house.\" A combination of US house, UK house, Italian house, and techno largely influenced one another during this era.[9] In June 1992, Mixmag published a list that contained what the magazine viewed as the top progressive house tracks at that time.[9] According to American DJ/producer duo Gabriel & Dresden, Leftfield's October 1990 release \"Not Forgotten\" was possibly the first progressive house production. The record label Guerilla Records, set up by William Orbit & Dick O'Dell, is thought to have been pivotal in the growth of a scene around the genre.[12] The 1994 Renaissance: The Mix Collection, mixed by Sasha and John Digweed, and Northern Exposure in 1996 have both been credited with establishing the genre, helping to define its sound and structure. As well as Guerilla Records, the labels Deconstruction Records, Hooj Choons and Soma Records contributed to the scene's development in the early to mid 1990s.[11] Among its derivative genres, progressive breaks emerged in the late 1990s as a subgenre of breaks. In the early 2000s, progressive house evolved by incorporating elements from deep house, tech house, and progressive trance. Pioneering artists such as Sasha, John Digweed, Hernán Cattáneo, and Sander Kleinenberg were instrumental in shaping its sound. This period also saw a convergence with the progressive trance movement, as artists like Deep Dish and Nick Warren infused more ethereal and cinematic elements into their productions.[3] In contrast to this trend, dark progressive house emerged as a deep, hypnotic and atmospheric variant of the genre.[13] By the 2010s, the term \"progressive house\" had broadened significantly, often diverging from its original underground meaning to a more mainstream and festival-oriented productions. This shift was reinforced by electronic music (EDM) charts and industry rankings, particularly DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs list[14] and digital platforms like Beatport,[15] which categorized a wide range of commercially successful tracks under the \"progressive house\" label. As a result, the genre's definition became increasingly ambiguous, with some artists and fans distinguishing between two distinct styles: the classic progressive house sound rooted in the 1990s and the more energetic, big room-influenced style that gained prominence in the 2010s.[3] This new style has been labeled with different terms such as mainstage progressive house,[16] festival progressive house,[17] and big room progressive house[18] to distinguish it from the original genre. During this period, the emerging style of progressive house gained widespread global popularity, thanks to artists such as Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, Alesso, Nicky Romero, and Martin Garrix. Avicii's 2011 hit \"Levels\" became one of the defining tracks of the era, blending uplifting melodies with festival-ready energy.[19] Similarly, Swedish House Mafia, the group composed by Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Steve Angello, propelled the genre further with \"Don't You Worry Child\" (2012),[20] an anthem that solidified progressive house's position in radio-friendly EDM. Swedish music labels Axtone, Refune, and Size played a pivotal role in defining the sound.[21] This era saw progressive house incorporating elements of big room house, a subgenre characterized by simplified structures, heavy drops, and grand, anthemic melodies, which take its roots in electro house. The fusion of these styles contributed to the commercial expansion of the genre, making it a staple at major EDM festivals worldwide.[4] Despite this shift, some artists remained committed to the original ethos, focusing on gradual builds, atmospheric textures, and intricate sound design. Eric Prydz[22] and Deadmau5, for instance, continued to refine and evolve the classic progressive house style, maintaining its connection to trance-influenced roots. \"Strobe\" by Deadmau5 is a good example, which had been cited by Billboard Dance as the artist's all-time best song.[23][24][5] In recent years, after the early 2010s commercial \"EDM boom\",[25] underground sounds have regained popularity. Labels like Anjunadeep, Lost & Found, and Sudbeat played a significant role in fostering this new wave of progressive house. These labels, led by artists such as James Grant, Guy J, Hernán Cattáneo focused on rich melodic structures, atmospheric soundscapes, and intricate arrangements, distancing themselves from the \"big room\" style that had dominated the EDM scene.[26][27] Furthermore, the new wave of melodic", "<2-hop>\n\nDark wave, or darkwave, is a music genre that emerged from the new wave and post-punk movement of the late 1970s.[5][6] Dark wave compositions are largely based on minor key tonality and introspective lyrics and have been perceived as being dark, romantic and bleak, with an undertone of sorrow.[5][7] Common features include the use of chordophones such as electric and acoustic guitar, violin and piano, as well as electronic instruments such as synthesizer, sampler and drum machine. Like new wave, dark wave is not considered an \"unified genre but rather an umbrella term\"[8] that encompasses a variety of musical styles, including cold wave,[9] ethereal wave,[10] gothic rock,[9][11][6] neoclassical dark wave[12] and neofolk.[11] In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose followers were called \"wavers\"[13][14] or \"dark wavers\".[15][16] In some countries, most notably Germany, the movement also included fans of gothic rock[1] (so-called \"trad-goths\").[17] Since the 1980s,[18][19][20] the term \"dark wave\" has been used in Europe by the music press[21] to describe the gloomy and melancholy variant of new wave and post-punk music.[5][22] At that time, the term \"goth\" was inseparably connected with gothic rock,[23] whereas \"dark wave\" acquired a broader meaning, embracing bands and solo artists that were associated with gothic rock[22] and synthesizer-based new wave music,[6][24] such as Bauhaus,[25] Joy Division,[20][26][27] the Cure,[26][28] Siouxsie and the Banshees,[26] the Sisters of Mercy,[26] Anne Clark,[29] Depeche Mode,[28][24] Gary Numan[24] and the Chameleons.[26] The term darkwave originated in the 1980s as an indicator of the dark counterpart of new wave. Bands such as Cocteau Twins, Soft Cell, and Depeche Mode are exponents of this first generation of darkwave. Darkwave... employs relatively slower tempos, lower pitches, and more minor keys in its musical settings of melancholy texts than new wave.[30] The movement spread internationally, developing such strands as ethereal wave, with bands such as Cocteau Twins, and neoclassical dark wave, initiated by the music of Dead Can Dance and In the Nursery.[31][32] French cold wave groups such as Clair Obscur[33] and Opera Multi Steel[34] have also been associated with the dark wave scene;[8] Rémy Lozowski, guitarist of French cold wave band Excès Nocturne, described his music as new wave noire (\"dark new wave\").[35] Simultaneously, different substyles associated with the new wave and dark wave movements started to merge and influence each other, e.g. synth-wave[3] (a kind of new wave with synthesizers, also referred to as \"electro-wave\"[36][37]) with gothic rock, or began to borrow elements of post-industrial music. Attrition,[38] Die Form (France), Pink Industry (UK), Psyche (Canada), Kirlian Camera (Italy) and Clan of Xymox (Netherlands)[39] performed this music in the 1980s. Other bands such as Malaria! and the Vyllies added elements of chanson and cabaret music. This sort of dark wave music became known as cabaret noir (or \"dark cabaret\", a term popularized by U.S. dark wave label Projekt Records).[22][40] German dark wave bands were partially associated with the Neue Deutsche Welle (i.e. German new wave),[41] and included Xmal Deutschland,[42] Mask For, Asmodi Bizarr,[8] II.

It features long tracks (typically 8–12 minutes) with evolving structures, subtle transitions, and layered melodies, creating a deep, hypnotic, and atmospheric experience on the dance floor.[30] Intensity is added by the regular addition and subtraction of layers of sound.[31] Phrases are typically 4, 8, or 16 bars long and often begin with a new or different melody or rhythm.[32] In the early 2000s, dark progressive house emerged as a hypnotic and atmospheric evolution of progressive house, moving away from mainstream trends, characterized by deep basslines, intricate percussion, and dark synths.[33] The 2010s mainstage progressive house style became more structured (4–6 minutes), favoring punchy kicks, bright supersaw leads, and anthemic melodies.

I found those two words (\"dark\" and \"wave\") quite interesting. This was something underground, submerged, obscure... which swept over you, immersed you, surrounded you. It was a poetic phrase that could describe many different sounds. At the time, I was looking for a name for my little mail-order company. I wanted something that would encompass the variety of music available in my catalog.[59] Projekt featured bands such as Lycia, Black Tape for a Blue Girl, and Love Spirals Downwards, some of these characterized by atmospheric guitar and synth-sounds and female vocals.[60] This style took cues from 1980s bands like Cocteau Twins[56] and is often referred to as ethereal dark wave.[61][56] Projekt Records has also had a long association with Attrition, who appeared on the label's earliest compilations.[62] Another American record label in this vein was Tess Records, which featured This Ascension, Faith and the Muse,[63] and the reunited Clan of Xymox.[64] Joshua Gunn, a professor of communication studies at Louisiana University, described the U.S. type of dark wave music as: ...an expansion of the rather limited gothic repertoire into electronica and, in a way, the US answer to the \"ethereal\" subgenre that developed in Europe (e.g. Dead Can Dance).

Other bands such as Malaria! and the Vyllies added elements of chanson and cabaret music. This sort of dark wave music became known as cabaret noir (or \"dark cabaret\", a term popularized by U.S. dark wave label Projekt Records).[22][40] German dark wave bands were partially associated with the Neue Deutsche Welle (i.e. German new wave),[41] and included Xmal Deutschland,[42] Mask For, Asmodi Bizarr,[8] II. Invasion,[8] Unlimited Systems, Moloko †, Maerchenbraut,[43][8] Cyan Revue,[18] Leningrad Sandwich,[18] Stimmen der Stille, Belfegore,[44] and Pink Turns Blue.[45][8]"], "reference": "Deine Lakaien is audibly influenced by the dark synthesizer sounds of Depeche Mode.

The German band Deine Lakaien ... is audibly influenced by the dark synthesizer sounds of Depeche Mode.[30] At the same time, a number of German artists, including Das Ich,[53] Goethes Erben,[53] Relatives Menschsein,[53] and Endraum,[53] developed a more theatrical style, interspersed with German poetic, metaphorical lyrics, called Neue Deutsche Todeskunst (literally New German Death Art).[53][54] Other bands, such as Silke Bischoff, In My Rosary,[55] Engelsstaub,[56] and Impressions of Winter[57] combined synthesizers with elements of neofolk and neoclassical dark wave.[56] After 1993, in the United States the term dark wave (as the one-word variant \"darkwave\") became associated with the Projekt Records label,[24] because it was adopted by label founder Sam Rosenthal after leafing through the pages of German music magazines such as Zillo, and has been used to promote and market artists from German label Hyperium Records in the U.S., e.g. Chandeen and Love Is Colder Than Death.[58] I first became aware of the term \"Dark Wave\" back in 1992. It appeared in German magazines – such as Zillo – describing a style of European music that followed other \"waves\" such as New Wave ... I found those two words (\"dark\" and \"wave\") quite interesting. This was something underground, submerged, obscure... which swept over you, immersed you, surrounded you. It was a poetic phrase that could describe many different sounds. At the time, I was looking for a name for my little mail-order company. I wanted something that would encompass the variety of music available in my catalog.[59] Projekt featured bands such as Lycia, Black Tape for a Blue Girl, and Love Spirals Downwards, some of these characterized by atmospheric guitar and synth-sounds and female vocals.[60] This style took cues from 1980s bands like Cocteau Twins[56] and is often referred to as ethereal dark wave.[61][56] Projekt Records has also had a long association with Attrition, who appeared on the label's earliest compilations.[62] Another American record label in this vein was Tess Records, which featured This Ascension, Faith and the Muse,[63] and the reunited Clan of Xymox.[64] Joshua Gunn, a professor of communication studies at Louisiana University, described the U.S. type of dark wave music as: ...an expansion of the rather limited gothic repertoire into electronica and, in a way, the US answer to the \"ethereal\" subgenre that developed in Europe (e.g. Dead Can Dance). Anchored by Sam Rosenthal's now New York-based label Projekt, dark wave music is less rock and more roll, supporting bands who tend to emphasize folk songcraft, hushed vocals, ambient experimentation, and synthesized sounds [...] Projekt bands like Love Spirals Downwards and Lycia are the most popular of this subgenre.[63] Neoclassical dark wave is a subgenre of dark wave music[65][12] that is characterized by incorporating elements of classical music[56] to create an ethereal, dramatic or melancholy atmosphere.[66][67] Neoclassical dark wave makes extensive use of orchestral components; many bands utilize modern production equipment (orchestra-derived synthesizer samples),[66] while others make use of chamber orchestras and acoustic instruments (e.g. string and brass instruments and orchestral percussion).[31] Vocals in the subgenre can vary; female voices predominate.[66][31] In the second half of the 1980s, former post-punk bands such as Dead Can Dance (Within the Realm of a Dying Sun, 1987[68]) and In the Nursery (Stormhorse, 1987[67]) released influential albums which essentially laid the foundations of the genre.[66][56] Other artists include Arcana,[31] Ataraxia,[66] Autumn Tears,[69] Camerata Mediolanense,[70] Dargaard,[71] Dark Sanctuary[31] Impressions of Winter,[72] Ophelia's Dream,[73] Les Secrets de Morphée,[56] Love Is Colder Than Death,[74] Stoa,[67] and WeltenBrand.[66]", "<2-hop>\n\nElevator music (also known as Muzak, piped music, or lift music) is a more general term indicating music that is played in rooms where many people come together (that is, not for the explicit purpose of listening to music), and during telephone calls when placed on hold. There is a specific sound associated with elevator music, but it usually involves simple instrumental themes from \"soft\" popular music, or \"light\" classical music being performed by slow strings.[3] More recent types of elevator music may be computer-generated, with the actual score being composed entirely algorithmically.[13][14] The term can also be used for kinds of easy listening,[15] piano solo, jazz or middle of the road music, or what are known as \"beautiful music\" radio stations. Corporate music (or corporate production music) is a term for background music, made to work with company presentations: rather subtle, understated and unobtrusive.[16] However, it should not be confused with \"corporate pop\" - pop music produced by corporations and that \"blurs the line between independent and mainstream\".[17] Video game music (VGM) is a soundtrack for video games. Songs may be original and composed specifically for the game, or preexisting music licensed for use in the game. Music in video games can be heard over a game's title screen, menus and during gameplay.[18] Sometimes, a soundtrack from a videogame can be released separately, as it happened with GTA V's in-game \"radiostations\"[19] The early social media website Myspace has supported a feature where specific songs chosen by the user would automatically play on their profile pages.[20] With the proliferation of boutique fitness classes in the late 2010s, a new emphasis is being placed on properly licensing music to be used by instructors in a group fitness environment. As it is more interactive than traditional background music, the licensing and cost structures differ. Internet-delivered background music was delivered by companies as Mood Media (which had acquired Trusonic, which had acquired Muzak). This allowed the retailer to instantly update music and messages which were deployed at the store level as opposed to using older compact disc and satellite technologies.[citation needed] Using this technique enables the creator to include more meaning in their work and effectively convey their messages. Playing music that affects the mood of the audience urges many emotions, making the work more memorable.[21] Business audio, also known as copyrighted material, refers to a type of service that provides audio content that is licensed for use in a commercial setting.[22] Business news can be one example. The term background music is another example. Providers of the latter include: In the United States, the terms \"elevator music\" and \"Muzak\" are commonly used to refer to business audio services that provide background music in retail settings.[23] Founded in 1934, Muzak was among the early background music providers. Business audio is produced off-site and delivered to the client via a number of methods including DBS satellite, SDARS satellite, coaxial cable, FM radio subcarrier, leased line, internet broadband, compact disc, and tape.[23] Most audio content is licensed for personal and home use only. Business audio services allow clients to use audio content in public and commercial settings by paying appropriate royalties to performing rights organizations like ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and GEMA in Germany.[citation needed]"], "reference": "Business audio services, which pay royalties to performing rights organizations like GEMA in Germany, allow clients to use audio content in commercial settings.
