{"user_input": "How did Grand Theft Auto: Vice City effect synthwave?", "reference_contexts": ["Synthwave (also called retrowave, or futuresynth[5]) is an electronic music microgenre that is based predominantly on the music associated with the film soundtracks of action films, science fiction films, and horror films of the 1980s.[2] Other influences are drawn from the decade's art and video games.[3] Synthwave musicians often espouse nostalgia for 1980s culture and attempt to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it.[9] The genre developed in the mid-to late 2000s through French house producers, as well as younger artists who were inspired by the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Other reference points included composers John Carpenter, Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis (especially his score for the 1982 film Blade Runner), and Tangerine Dream. Synthwave reached wider popularity after being featured in the soundtracks of the 2011 film Drive (which included some of the genre's best-known songs), the 2012 video game Hotline Miami as well as its 2015 sequel, the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok, and the Netflix series Stranger Things. Synthwave is a microgenre[10][11] of electronic music[1] that draws predominantly from 1980s films, video games, and cartoons,[12] as well as composers such as John Carpenter, Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream.[13][14] Other reference points include electronic dance music genres including house, synth, and nu-disco.[15] It is primarily an instrumental genre, although there are occasional exceptions to the rule.[16] Common tempos are between 80 and 118 BPM, while more upbeat tracks may be between 128 and 140 BPM.[17] \"Outrun\" is a subgenre of synthwave that was later used to refer more generally to retro 1980s aesthetics such as VHS tracking artefacts, magenta neon, and gridlines.[16] The term comes from the 1986 arcade racing game Out Run, which is known for its soundtrack that could be selected in-game and its 1980s aesthetic.[14][18] According to musician Perturbator (James Kent), outrun is also its own subgenre, mainly instrumental, and often contains 1980s clichéd elements in the sound such as electronic drums, gated reverb, and analogue synthesizer bass lines and leads—all to resemble tracks from that time period.[19] There is also a visual component on synthwave album covers and music videos. According to PC Gamer, the essence of outrun visuals is \"taking elements of a period of '80s excess millennials find irresistibly evocative, and modernizing them so they're just barely recognizable.\"[20] Other subgenres include dreamwave, darksynth, and scifiwave.[7] Journalist Julia Neuman cited \"outrun\", \"futuresynth\", and \"retrowave\" as alternative terms for synthwave[5] while author Nicholas Diak wrote that \"retrowave\" was an umbrella term that encompasses 1980s revivalism genres such as synthwave and vaporwave.[16] Darksynth is influenced by horror cinema.[21] Invisible Oranges wrote that darksynth is exemplified mainly by a shift away from the bright \"Miami Vice vibes\" and \"French electro house influences\" and \"toward the darker electronic terrains of horror movie maestro composers John Carpenter and Goblin\" also infused with sounds from post-punk, industrial and EBM.[22] Synthwave originates from the mid to late 2000s.[23][4] Diak traced the genre to a broader trend involving young artists whose works drew from their childhoods in the 1980s. He credited the success of the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City with shifting \"attitudes toward the '80s ... from parody and ambivalence to that of homage and reverence\", leading directly to genres such as synthwave and vaporwave.[16] The influence of Vice City was also noted by MusicRadar.[10] Molly Lambert of MTV noted the song \"Love on a Real Train\" by Tangerine Dream in the film Risky Business (1983) was a major influence, with \"ornately repetitive synth patterns, hypnotic chimes, and percussive choogling drum machines\".[14] The mid-2000s French house acts David Grellier (College), and Kavinsky, who had created music in the style of 1980s film scores, were among the earliest artists to be part of the emergence of synthwave.[5] Key reference points for early synthwave included the 1982 film Blade Runner (both the soundtrack and the film itself), 8- and 16-bit video games, 1980s jingles for VHS production companies, and television news broadcasts and advertisements from that era.[4] According to NME and MusicRadar, the 2011 film Drive was a major influence on synthwave, and included a track by Kavinsky, \"Nightcall\" in the film's soundtrack,[24][10] as well as David Grellier, Johnny Jewel, and several tracks by Cliff Martinez.[10] EDM.com described Kavinsky as a \"synthwave pioneer\",[25] while the horror blog Bloody Disgusting describes Carpenter Brut as a \"synthwave icon\".[26] In the early 2010s, the synthwave soundtracks of films such as Drive and Tron: Legacy attracted new fans and artists to the genre.[7] Drive featured Kavinsky's \"Nightcall\" and \"A Real Hero\" by College and Electric Youth, which catapulted synthwave into mainstream recognition and solidified its stature as a music genre.[4] The genre's popularity was furthered through its presence in the soundtracks of video games like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and Hotline Miami, as well as the Netflix series Stranger Things, which featured synthwave pieces that complemented the show's 1980s setting.[4][27] Nerdglow's Christopher Higgins cited Electric Youth and Kavinsky as the two most popular artists in synthwave in 2014.[12] In 2016, British band The 1975 released the critically acclaimed synthwave-influenced track \"Somebody Else\". The track comes as their third single for their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. It has been cited as a major influence on many contemporaries' work, such as Lorde, Tate McRae and Olivia Rodrigo. Synthwave remained a niche genre throughout the 2010s. In 2017, PC Gamer noted that synthwave influences were to be felt in early 2010s gaming releases, primarily of the \"outrun\" subgenre, including Hotline Miami and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.[20] Writing in 2019, PopMatters journalist Preston Cram said, \"Despite its significant presence and the high level of enthusiasm about it, synthwave in its complete form remains a primarily underground form of music.\"[4] He added that \"Nightcall\" and \"A Real Hero\" remained \"two of only a small number of synthwave songs produced to date that [are] widely known outside the genre's followers.\"[4] The 2019 virtual reality game Boneworks heavily features the synthwave genre"], "reference": "The 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City inspired younger artists and shifted \"attitudes toward the '80s ... from parody and ambivalence to that of homage and reverence\", leading directly to genres such as synthwave.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

{"user_input": "How did BBC Radio 1 contribute to the rise and mainstream acceptance of dubstep music in the UK?", "reference_contexts": ["Dubstep is generally characterised by the use of syncopated rhythmic patterns, with prominent basslines, and a dark tone. In 2001, this underground sound and other strains of garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), and on the pirate radio station Rinse FM, which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in these remixes became more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime.[4] A very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, a listeners vote included songs by Distance, Digital Mystikz, and Plastician as the top 50 for the year.[5] Dubstep started to enter mainstream British popular culture when it spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz.[6] Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled \"Dubstep Warz\") in January 2006.[7][8][9] Towards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including future garage and the slower and more experimental post-dubstep. The harsher electro-house and heavy metal–influenced variant brostep, led by American producers such as Skrillex, greatly contributed to dubstep's popularity in the United States.[10] The music website AllMusic has described dubstep's overall sound as \"tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals.\"[11] According to Simon Reynolds, dubstep's constituents originally came from \"different points in the 1989—99 UK lineage: bleep 'n' bass, jungle, techstep, Photek-style neurofunk, speed garage, [and] 2 step.\"[2] Reynolds comments that the traces of pre-existing styles \"worked through their intrinsic sonic effects but also as signifiers, tokenings-back addressed to those who know\".[2] Dubstep's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the 2-step garage sound. These experiments often ended up on the B-side of a white label or commercial garage release.[7][12][13] Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key or the Phrygian mode, and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff.[14] Compared to other styles of garage music, dubstep tends to be more minimalistic, focusing on prominent sub-bass frequencies.[15] Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.[15][16][17]"], "reference": "BBC Radio 1 played a significant role in dubstep's rise.

{"user_input": "Considering the origins of Chicago house music in clubs like the Warehouse, how does its emphasis on bass-heavy loops and synthesizer basslines compare to the fusion of country music with hip-hop, particularly in the subgenre of country rap, and what are some key differences in their respective cultural contexts and musical elements?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nChicago house, is built on the clave pattern.[17] Congas and bongos may be added for an African sound, or metallic percussion for a Latin feel.[16] Sometimes, the drum sounds are \"saturated\" by boosting the gain to create a more aggressive edge.[16] One classic subgenre, acid house, is defined through the squelchy sounds created by the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. House music could be produced on \"cheap and consumer-friendly electronic equipment\" and used sound gear, which made it easier for independent labels and DJs to create tracks.[18] The electronic drum machines and other gear used by house DJs and producers were formerly considered \"too cheap-sounding\" by \"proper\" musicians.[19] House music producers typically use sampled instruments, rather than bringing session musicians into a recording studio.[20] Even though a key element of house production is layering sounds, such as drum machine beats, samples, synth basslines, and so on, the overall \"texture...is relatively sparse\".[21] Unlike pop songs, which emphasize higher-pitched sounds like melody, in house music, the lower-pitched bass register is most important.[21] House tracks typically involve an intro, a chorus, various verse sections, a midsection, and a brief outro. Some tracks do not have a verse, taking a vocal part from the chorus and repeating the same cycle. House music tracks are often based on eight-bar sections which are repeated.[21] They are often built around bass-heavy loops or basslines produced by a synthesizer and/or around samples of disco, soul,[22] jazz-funk,[6] or funk[22] songs. DJs and producers creating a house track to be played in clubs may make a \"seven or eight-minute 12-inch mix\"; if the track is intended to be played on the radio, a \"three-and-a-half-minute\" radio edit is used.[23] House tracks build up slowly, by adding layers of sound and texture, and by increasing the volume.[21] House tracks may have vocals like a pop song, but some are \"completely minimal instrumental music\".[21] If a house track does have vocals, the vocal lines may also be simple \"words or phrases\" that are repeated.[21] One book from 2009 states the name \"house music\" originated from a Chicago club called the Warehouse that was open from 1977 to 1982.[24] Clubbers to the Warehouse were primarily black gay men,[25][12] who came to dance to music played by the club's resident DJ, Frankie Knuckles, who fans refer to as the \"godfather of house\". Frankie began the trend of splicing together different records when he found that the records he had were not long enough to satisfy his audience of dancers.[26] After the Warehouse closed in 1983, eventually the crowds went to Knuckles' new club, The Power House, later to be called The Power Plant,[24] and the club was renamed, yet again, into Music Box with Ron Hardy as the resident DJ.[27] The 1986 documentary, \"House Music in Chicago\", by filmmaker Phil Ranstrom, captured opening night at The Power House, and stands as the only film or video to capture a young Frankie Knuckles in this early era, right after his departure from The Warehouse.[28][29][30][31] In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up the Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term \"house music\" was upon seeing \"we play house music\" on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car joked, \"you know that's the kind of music you play down at the Warehouse!\"[32] In self-published statements, South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard \"Remix\" Rroy claimed he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's home; in his case, it referred to his mother's soul and disco records, which he worked into his sets.[33] Chicago house artist Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk was quoted as saying, \"In 1982, I was DJing at a club called The Playground and there was this kid named Leonard 'Remix' Rroy who was a DJ at a rival club called The Rink. He came over to my club one night, and into the DJ booth and said to me, 'I've got the gimmick that's gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine – it's called House music'. Now, where he got that name from or what made him think of it I don't know, so the answer lies with him\".[34] Chicago artist Chip E.'s 1985 song \"It's House\" may also have helped to define this new form of electronic music.[35] However, Chip E. himself lends credence to the Knuckles association, claiming the name came from methods of labeling records at the Importes Etc. record store, where he worked in the early 1980s. Bins of music that DJ Knuckles played at the Warehouse nightclub were labelled \"As Heard at the Warehouse\" in the store, shortened to \"House\". Patrons later asked for new music for the bins, which Chip E. implies was a demand the shop tried to meet by stocking newer local club hits.[36] In a 1986 interview, when Rocky Jones, the club DJ who ran Chicago-based DJ International Records, was asked about the \"house\" moniker, and he did not mention Importes Etc., Frankie Knuckles, or the Warehouse by name. However, he agreed that \"house\" was a regional catch-all term for dance music, and that it was once synonymous with older disco music before it became a way to refer to \"new\" dance music.[37] Larry Heard, a.k.a. \"Mr. Fingers\", claims that the term \"house\" came from DJs creating music in their house or at home using synthesizers and drum machines, such as the Roland TB-303,[38] Roland TR-808, and TR-909.[39] These synthesizers were used to create the acid house subgenre.[40] Juan Atkins, a pioneer of Detroit techno, claims the term \"house\" reflected the association of particular tracks with particular clubs and DJs, considered their \"house\" records.[41] At least three styles of dancing are associated with early house music: jacking, footwork and lofting.[42] These styles include a variety of techniques and sub-styles, including skating, stomping, vosho, pouting cat, and shuffle steps (also see Melbourne shuffle).[43][44] House music dancing styles can", "<2-hop>\n\nCountry rap (also called country hip-hop and sometimes hick-hop) is a fusion genre of popular music, blending country music with hip-hop–style singing or rapping.[1][2] Early influences on the emergence of country rap as a distinct genre include talking blues like \"Big Bad John\" (1961) by Jimmy Dean, \"A Boy Named Sue\" (1969) by Johnny Cash, the 1971 cover of \"Hot Rod Lincoln\" by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, \"Convoy\" (1975) by C.W. McCall and \"Uneasy Rider\" (1975) and \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" (1979), both by Charlie Daniels. Black artists' works that may have been influential in the genre's development include Jamaican ska artist Prince Buster's \"Texas Hold-Up\" (1964), \"Lil Ole Country Boy\" (1970) by Parliament, and \"Black Grass\" (1972) by Bad Bascomb.[3] Music journalist Chuck Eddy traces the genre's roots back to Woody Guthrie.[4] Blowfly's single \"Blowfly's Rapp\" (1980) drew on the influence of earlier country musicians like Charlie Daniels and C. W. McCall; NPR said the song is a \"Deliverance-style encounter with Ku Klux Klan-accredited truck drivers to light funkbacking\".[5] Spin Magazine said Trickeration's \"Western Gangster Town\" (1980) (released four years before Schoolly D's \"Gangster Boogie\") is \"cowboy rap's Rosetta stone, and probably the first 'gangster' rap\".[3] Other early examples of country rap are Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"Square Dance Rap\" (1985) where he raps in the voice of a \"white country boy\". The lyric \"From L.A. to Carolina / Drop them suckers in Aunt Jemima\" in Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"Buttermilk Biscuits\" (1988) is a reference to what many consider a racial stereotype, trademarked after Chris L. Rutt heard a performance of the minstrel song \"Old Aunt Jemima\" (1876).[3] The song \"Rappin' Duke\" (1985) is a parody of western film star John Wayne: \"Two hundred punks, well, what you gonna do? / I got two six-shooters that'll see me through\". The song also contains a reference to \"Old Folks at Home\" (1851).[3] The genre-blending was not limited only to hip-hop artists; country duo Bellamy Brothers released \"Country Rap\" (1987) with lyrics about soul food, church, turnip greens and black-eyed peas.[6] UGK became pioneers of the hardcore Southern rap style that emerged after the success of the Geto Boys, which they started to call \"country rap\". At the end of \"Let Me See It\", Pimp C raps: \"This ain't no muthafuckin' hip-hop records, these country rap tunes\", originally a response to Northern hip-hop artists who had criticized Southern rap for not being \"real hip-hop\".[7] The name of the song \"Hay\" (1996) by Crucial Conflict is a reference to marijuana.[8] Kid Rock's \"Cowboy\", released in 1999, reflects a cross-section of Kid Rock's country music, Southern rock and hip-hop influences,[9] even quoting a piano riff from the Doors song \"L.A. Woman\".[3][10] Kid Rock has described the song as a cross between Run DMC and Lynyrd Skynyrd.[11] Kid Rock's former DJ, Uncle Kracker, was another pioneer of country rap in his solo career.[12] In the early 2000s, producer Shannon \"Fat Shan\" Houchins and Bubba Sparxxx released Sparxxx's 2001 debut album Dark Days, Bright Nights as an independent release. The blend of country and trap caught the attention of producer Jimmy Iovine who re-released the album on Interscope.[13][14] Houchins soon after created Average Joes Entertainment with Colt Ford.[15] With songs like \"No Trash in My Trailer\" (2008) and \"Drivin' Around Song\" (2013), Ford has sold over one million albums.[16][17][18] In 2003, UK artist Eminemmylou coined the term \"hip hopry\" and produced a \"hip hopry\" version of Eminem's \"The Way I Am\" and 50 Cent's \"P.I.M.P.\" (subtitled \"Limp Version\"), adding banjo and country instrumentation to the rap hits as well as writing her own songs such as \"When Gram Met Eminem\" about \"creating a brand new sound\" on her country rap album Muthabanjo.[19][20] A sole proponent of country rap in the UK at the time, Eminemmylou performed at the International Country Hip Hop Festival in New York in March 2006 alongside Rench and other US country rap bands at the venue Southpaw, Brooklyn.[21][22] The trend continued in 2005 when country music stars Big & Rich introduced Cowboy Troy and his album Loco Motive. Troy has said he uses \"country instrumentation\" that includes a banjo, fiddle, and acoustic guitar blended with \"shredding rock guitar riffs and a rap delivery\".[23] Hal Crowther has written that \"I Play Chicken with the Train\" (2006) by Cowboy Troy was \"scandalous not because it mixes 'black' rap with 'white' country, but because, through the sheer force of unlikely-but-seamless juxtaposition, it forces us to acknowledge that those two musical styles, at least when they whoop it up, are brothers under the skin\".[24] In the late 2010s, country rap returned to prominence as part of the \"Yee Haw\" movement, a trend characterized by hip-hop producers incorporating country music into their own recordings. Young Thug's 2017 song \"Family Don't Matter\" is credited with popularizing the movement. Artists within \"Yee Haw\" include Lil Tracy and DaBaby.[25] Other country rap artists include Ryan Upchurch, Jawga Boyz, Bottleneck, Moonshine Bandits and Big Smo.[26] Cowboy Troy, Lenny Cooper and The Lacs were three of the top country rap artists of 2013 each with an album on Billboard's Country Chart.[16] Also in the 2010s, hip-hop influences were widely noted in mainstream country songs especially in the bro-country genre. In 2020, Niko Moon's \"Good Time\" peaked at number 20 on the Hot 100[27] – with the track being a hip-hop song with country influence, or vice versa.[28] The same year, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus released a heavily rap-inspired country song from his Mama Kush project titled “Ballad of Jed,” while also world-premiering an animated music video, which debuted on Weedmaps in celebration of 4/20.[29] In 2019, rapper Lil Nas X's \"country trap\" single \"Old Town Road\" achieved mainstream international success.[30] Assisted by several subsequent versions, including a remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, the song broke multiple U.S. streaming records and charted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for a record nineteen weeks.[31][32] In June 2019, Blanco Brown's \"The Git Up\", also described by USA Today as"], "reference": "Chicago house music, originating in clubs like the Warehouse, is characterized by its emphasis on bass-heavy loops and synthesizer basslines, often built around samples of disco, soul, jazz-funk, or funk songs.

Artists within \"Yee Haw\" include Lil Tracy and DaBaby.[25] Other country rap artists include Ryan Upchurch, Jawga Boyz, Bottleneck, Moonshine Bandits and Big Smo.[26] Cowboy Troy, Lenny Cooper and The Lacs were three of the top country rap artists of 2013 each with an album on Billboard's Country Chart.[16] Also in the 2010s, hip-hop influences were widely noted in mainstream country songs especially in the bro-country genre. In 2020, Niko Moon's \"Good Time\" peaked at number 20 on the Hot 100[27] – with the track being a hip-hop song with country influence, or vice versa.[28] The same year, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus released a heavily rap-inspired country song from his Mama Kush project titled “Ballad of Jed,” while also world-premiering an animated music video, which debuted on Weedmaps in celebration of 4/20.[29] In 2019, rapper Lil Nas X's \"country trap\" single \"Old Town Road\" achieved mainstream international success.[30] Assisted by several subsequent versions, including a remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, the song broke multiple U.S. streaming records and charted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for a record nineteen weeks.[31][32] In June 2019, Blanco Brown's \"The Git Up\", also described by USA Today as", "<2-hop>\n\na \"trap-country\" song, also achieved viral success.[33] Other notable country trap songs include \"Rodeo\" by Lil Nas X and Cardi B and \"Rascal\" by RMR. The Mo Thugs Family single \"Ghetto Cowboy\" (1998) is noted for featuring a harmonica.[34] Rolling Stone said of \"Cruise (Remix)\" (2012) by Florida Georgia Line featuring Nelly, that the track \"ushered in the wave of escapist fantasies set to syncopated drum loops that became known as 'bro country'.[35][34] Florida Georgia Line has said that Nelly's part \"just connected\", helping to make the \"Cruise\" remix which was produced and conceptualized by veteran producer, Jason Nevins,[36] reach the No. 1 and No. 4 positions on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively; it also became the first country single to ever gain a RIAA diamond certification.[37] B.o.B and pop singer Taylor Swift collaborated on \"Both of Us\" (2012). The track features Swift's country vocals and a blend of hip-hop with banjos. It became a top 10 hit in Australia and New Zealand and a top 20 hit in the US.[38] Country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J recorded the controversial song \"Accidental Racist\" for Paisley's 2013 album Wheelhouse.[39] Other collaborations include \"Po' Folks\" (2002) by Nappy Roots with Anthony Hamilton, \"Country Folks\" (2012) by Bubba Sparxxx featuring Colt Ford & Danny Boone, \"Dirt Road Anthem\" (remix) by Jason Aldean and Ludacris, and \"Try Harder Than That\" by Meghan Linsey with Bubba Sparxxx (2014).[34][38] Physical sales of country rap albums are higher in more rural areas where country rap fans do not have the Internet services required to stream or download music.[40] There are numerous country rap festivals where artists gather to play their music for upwards of 7,000 fans.[40] The term \"hick-hop\" is often criticized by some southern artists, with Struggle Jennings saying, \"I love the country, I love the South, I've been fishing and hunting, but I'm not a hick. I'm not hick-hop\".[40] The political ideology of country rap artists is perceived as being right-wing or conservative, due to some right-leaning politics expressed by artists like Upchurch and Forgiato Blow;[40] however the political ideology of country rap artists ranges the full spectrum of political beliefs.[40]"], "reference": "The political ideology of country rap artists ranges the full spectrum of political beliefs.

{"user_input": "Considering the significant role of Latinos in the early house music scene, and the incorporation of Latin musical elements like congas and bongos for a Latin feel, how did house music, particularly in Chicago, create a space for Latinos and other minorities, and what specific Latin-inspired sounds were integrated into the music?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\ninclude movements from many other forms of dance, such as waacking, voguing, capoeira, jazz dance, Lindy Hop, tap dance, and even modern dance.[45][44] House dancing is associated with a complete freedom of expression.[46] One of the primary elements in house dancing is \"the jack\" or \"jacking\" — a style created in the early days of Chicago house that left its trace in numerous record titles such as \"Time to Jack\" by Chip E. from the Jack Trax EP (1985), \"Jack'n the House\" by Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk (1985) or \"Jack Your Body\" by Steve \"Silk\" Hurley (1986). It involves moving the torso forward and backward in a rippling motion matching the beat of the music, as if a wave were passing through it.[46] Early house lyrics contained generally positive, uplifting messages, but spoke especially to those who were considered to be outsiders, especially African Americans, Latinos, and the gay subculture. The house music dance scene was one of the most integrated and progressive spaces in the 1980s; the black and gay populations, as well as other minority groups, were able to dance together in a positive environment.[47] House music DJs aimed to create a \"dream world of emotions\" with \"stories, keywords and sounds\", which helped to \"glue\" communities together.[18] Many house tracks encourage the audience to \"release yourself\" or \"let yourself go\", which is further encouraged by the continuous dancing, \"incessant beat\", and use of club drugs, which can create a trance-like effect on dancers.[18] Frankie Knuckles once said that the Warehouse club in Chicago was like \"church for people who have fallen from grace\". House record producer Marshall Jefferson compared it to \"old-time religion in the way that people just get happy and screamin'\".[46] The role of a house DJ has been compared to a \"secular type of priest\".[18] Some house lyrics contained messages calling for equality, unity, and freedom of expression beyond racial or sexual differences (e.g. \"Can You Feel It\" by Fingers Inc., 1987, or \"Follow Me\" by Aly-Us, 1992). Later on in the 1990s, independently from the Chicago scene, the idea of Peace, Love, Unity & Respect (PLUR) became a widespread set of principles for the rave culture.[48] One of the main influences of house was disco, house music having been defined as a genre which \"...picked up where disco left off in the late 1970's\".[49][50] Like disco DJs, house DJs used a \"slow mix\" to \"lin[k] records together\" into a mix.[18] In the post-disco club culture during the early 1980s, DJs from the gay scene made their tracks \"less pop-oriented\", with a more mechanical, repetitive beat and deeper basslines, and many tracks were made without vocals, or with wordless melodies.[51] Disco became so popular by the late 1970s that record companies pushed even non-disco artists (R&B and soft rock acts, for example) to record disco songs. When the backlash against disco started, known as \"Disco Demolition Night\", held in Chicago, ironically the city where house music would be created a few years later, dance music went from being produced by major labels to being created by DJs in the underground club scene. That is until several years later by 1988, when major labels would begin signing acts from this new dance genre.[18] While disco was associated with lush orchestration, with string orchestra, flutes and horn sections, various later disco songs incorporated sounds produced with synthesizers and electronic drum machines, and some compositions were entirely electronic: one of the earliest examples includes Italian composer Giorgio Moroder's late 1970s productions such as Donna Summer's hit single \"I Feel Love\" (1977), or albums like Cerrone's Supernature (1977),[52] Kraftwerk's The Man-Machine (1978),[53] Yellow Magic Orchestra's synth- and disco-pop productions from Yellow Magic Orchestra (1978) or Solid State Survivor (1979),[54][55] and several early 1980s productions by Hi-NRG groups like Lime, Trans-X and Bobby O. Also important for the development of house were audio mixing and editing techniques earlier explored by disco, garage house and post-disco DJs, record producers, and audio engineers such as Walter Gibbons, Tom Moulton, Jim Burgess, Larry Levan, M & M, and others. While most post-disco disc jockeys primarily stuck to playing their conventional ensemble and playlist of dance records, Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy, two influential DJs of house music, were known for their unusual and non-mainstream playlists and mixing. Knuckles, often credited as \"the Godfather of House\" and resident DJ at the Warehouse club in Chicago from 1977 to 1982, worked primarily with early disco music with a hint of new and different post-punk or post-disco music.[56] Knuckles started out as a disco DJ, but when he moved from New York City to Chicago, he changed from the typical disco mixing style of playing records one after another; instead, he mixed different songs together, including Philadelphia soul and Euro disco.[21] He also explored adding a drum machine and a reel-to-reel tape player so he could create new tracks, often with a boosted deep register and faster tempos. Knuckles said: \"Kraftwerk were main components in the creation of house music in Chicago. Back in the early '80s, I mixed our '80s Philly sound with the electro beats of Kraftwerk and the Electronic body music bands of Europe.\"[21][57] Ron Hardy produced unconventional DIY mixtapes which he later played straight-on in the successor of the Warehouse, the Music Box (reopened and renamed in 1983 after Knuckles left). Like Frankie Knuckles, Hardy \"combined certain sounds, remixing tracks with added synths and drum machines\", all \"refracted through the futurist lens of European music\".[19] Marshall Jefferson, who would later appear with the 1986 house classic \"Move Your Body (The House Music Anthem)\" (originally released on Trax Records), describes how he got involved in house music after hearing Ron Hardy's music in the Music Box: \"I wasn't even into dance music before I went to the Music Box [...]. I was into rock and roll. We would get drunk and listen to rock and roll. We didn't give a fuck, we were like 'Disco Sucks!' and all that. I hated dance music 'cos", "<2-hop>\n\nChicago house, is built on the clave pattern.[17] Congas and bongos may be added for an African sound, or metallic percussion for a Latin feel.[16] Sometimes, the drum sounds are \"saturated\" by boosting the gain to create a more aggressive edge.[16] One classic subgenre, acid house, is defined through the squelchy sounds created by the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. House music could be produced on \"cheap and consumer-friendly electronic equipment\" and used sound gear, which made it easier for independent labels and DJs to create tracks.[18] The electronic drum machines and other gear used by house DJs and producers were formerly considered \"too cheap-sounding\" by \"proper\" musicians.[19] House music producers typically use sampled instruments, rather than bringing session musicians into a recording studio.[20] Even though a key element of house production is layering sounds, such as drum machine beats, samples, synth basslines, and so on, the overall \"texture...is relatively sparse\".[21] Unlike pop songs, which emphasize higher-pitched sounds like melody, in house music, the lower-pitched bass register is most important.[21] House tracks typically involve an intro, a chorus, various verse sections, a midsection, and a brief outro. Some tracks do not have a verse, taking a vocal part from the chorus and repeating the same cycle. House music tracks are often based on eight-bar sections which are repeated.[21] They are often built around bass-heavy loops or basslines produced by a synthesizer and/or around samples of disco, soul,[22] jazz-funk,[6] or funk[22] songs. DJs and producers creating a house track to be played in clubs may make a \"seven or eight-minute 12-inch mix\"; if the track is intended to be played on the radio, a \"three-and-a-half-minute\" radio edit is used.[23] House tracks build up slowly, by adding layers of sound and texture, and by increasing the volume.[21] House tracks may have vocals like a pop song, but some are \"completely minimal instrumental music\".[21] If a house track does have vocals, the vocal lines may also be simple \"words or phrases\" that are repeated.[21] One book from 2009 states the name \"house music\" originated from a Chicago club called the Warehouse that was open from 1977 to 1982.[24] Clubbers to the Warehouse were primarily black gay men,[25][12] who came to dance to music played by the club's resident DJ, Frankie Knuckles, who fans refer to as the \"godfather of house\". Frankie began the trend of splicing together different records when he found that the records he had were not long enough to satisfy his audience of dancers.[26] After the Warehouse closed in 1983, eventually the crowds went to Knuckles' new club, The Power House, later to be called The Power Plant,[24] and the club was renamed, yet again, into Music Box with Ron Hardy as the resident DJ.[27] The 1986 documentary, \"House Music in Chicago\", by filmmaker Phil Ranstrom, captured opening night at The Power House, and stands as the only film or video to capture a young Frankie Knuckles in this early era, right after his departure from The Warehouse.[28][29][30][31] In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up the Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term \"house music\" was upon seeing \"we play house music\" on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car joked, \"you know that's the kind of music you play down at the Warehouse!\"[32] In self-published statements, South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard \"Remix\" Rroy claimed he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's home; in his case, it referred to his mother's soul and disco records, which he worked into his sets.[33] Chicago house artist Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk was quoted as saying, \"In 1982, I was DJing at a club called The Playground and there was this kid named Leonard 'Remix' Rroy who was a DJ at a rival club called The Rink. He came over to my club one night, and into the DJ booth and said to me, 'I've got the gimmick that's gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine – it's called House music'. Now, where he got that name from or what made him think of it I don't know, so the answer lies with him\".[34] Chicago artist Chip E.'s 1985 song \"It's House\" may also have helped to define this new form of electronic music.[35] However, Chip E. himself lends credence to the Knuckles association, claiming the name came from methods of labeling records at the Importes Etc. record store, where he worked in the early 1980s. Bins of music that DJ Knuckles played at the Warehouse nightclub were labelled \"As Heard at the Warehouse\" in the store, shortened to \"House\". Patrons later asked for new music for the bins, which Chip E. implies was a demand the shop tried to meet by stocking newer local club hits.[36] In a 1986 interview, when Rocky Jones, the club DJ who ran Chicago-based DJ International Records, was asked about the \"house\" moniker, and he did not mention Importes Etc., Frankie Knuckles, or the Warehouse by name. However, he agreed that \"house\" was a regional catch-all term for dance music, and that it was once synonymous with older disco music before it became a way to refer to \"new\" dance music.[37] Larry Heard, a.k.a. \"Mr. Fingers\", claims that the term \"house\" came from DJs creating music in their house or at home using synthesizers and drum machines, such as the Roland TB-303,[38] Roland TR-808, and TR-909.[39] These synthesizers were used to create the acid house subgenre.[40] Juan Atkins, a pioneer of Detroit techno, claims the term \"house\" reflected the association of particular tracks with particular clubs and DJs, considered their \"house\" records.[41] At least three styles of dancing are associated with early house music: jacking, footwork and lofting.[42] These styles include a variety of techniques and sub-styles, including skating, stomping, vosho, pouting cat, and shuffle steps (also see Melbourne shuffle).[43][44] House music dancing styles can"], "reference": "Early house lyrics contained positive messages that spoke to outsiders, especially African Americans, Latinos, and the gay subculture, creating an integrated and progressive space in the 1980s.

In 2001, this underground sound and other strains of garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), and on the pirate radio station Rinse FM, which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in these remixes became more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime.[4] A very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, a listeners vote included songs by Distance, Digital Mystikz, and Plastician as the top 50 for the year.[5] Dubstep started to enter mainstream British popular culture when it spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz.[6] Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled \"Dubstep Warz\") in January 2006.[7][8][9] Towards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including future garage and the slower and more experimental post-dubstep. The harsher electro-house and heavy metal–influenced variant brostep, led by American producers such as Skrillex, greatly contributed to dubstep's popularity in the United States.[10] The music website AllMusic has described dubstep's overall sound as \"tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals.\"[11] According to Simon Reynolds, dubstep's constituents originally came from \"different points in the 1989—99 UK lineage: bleep 'n' bass, jungle, techstep, Photek-style neurofunk, speed garage, [and] 2 step.\"[2] Reynolds comments that the traces of pre-existing styles \"worked through their intrinsic sonic effects but also as signifiers, tokenings-back addressed to those who know\".[2] Dubstep's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the 2-step garage sound. These experiments often ended up on the B-side of a white label or commercial garage release.[7][12][13] Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key or the Phrygian mode, and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff.[14] Compared to other styles of garage music, dubstep tends to be more minimalistic, focusing on prominent sub-bass frequencies.[15] Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.[15][16][17]", "<2-hop>\n\nNew Here (2011), a Gil Scott-Heron remix album.[105] In 2011, dubstep gained significant traction in the US market, by way of a post-dubstep style known as brostep,[citation needed]with the American producer Skrillex becoming something of a \"poster boy\" for the scene.[111][112][113] In September 2011, a Spin Magazine EDM special referred to brostep as a \"lurching and aggressive\" variant of dubstep that has proven commercially successful in the United States.[114] Unlike traditional dubstep production styles, which emphasise sub-bass content, brostep accentuates the middle register and features \"robotic fluctuations and metal-esque aggression\".[115] According to Simon Reynolds, as dubstep gained larger audiences and moved from smaller club-based venues to larger outdoor events, sub-sonic content was gradually replaced by distorted bass riffs that function roughly in the same register as the electric guitar in heavy metal.[116] The term brostep has been used by some as a pejorative descriptor for a style of popular dubstep developed in the United States.[111] The producer known as Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that \"brostep is sort of my fault, but now I've started to hate it in a way ... It's like someone screaming in your face ... you don't want that.\"[117] According to a BBC review of his 2012 album Songs, the record was a muddled attempt by Rusko to realign his music with a \"Jamaican inheritance\" and distance it from the \"belching, aggressive, resolutely macho\" dubstep produced by his contemporaries.[118] Commenting on the success of American producers such as Skrillex, Skream stated: \"I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side of that is that a lot of people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes.\"[119] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as \"a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage\".[120] The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision.[121] This style of dubstep is sometimes known as metalstep. In the early 2010s, UK artists began to play with a style of dubstep reminiscent of a resurgence or continuation of original British dubstep styles. This became known as Riddim, a name coined by British producer Jakes around 2012. The name comes from the Jamaican Patois term riddim, which refers to the instrumental of dub, reggae and dancehall music.[122] Riddim is characterised by repetitive and minimalist sub-bass and triplet percussion arrangements, similar to original dubstep, with a sound described as \"wonky\".[122][123] Riddim is looked upon as a subgenre of dubstep, similarly to other sub genres like brostep, drum-step, and wobble-step.[122] It started gaining significant popularity around 2015.[124] It is said that those who enjoy this style of music describe it as the \"dirtier, swaggier\" side of dubstep, whereas those looking at this from the outside, claim that it is \"repetitive and chaotic\".[122] Notable artists of the genre include Subfiltronik, Bukez Finezt, P0gman, Badklaat, 50 Carrot, Dubloadz and Coffi.[125] Notable tracks of the genre include \"Yasuo\" by Bommer and Crowell, \"Orgalorg\" by Infekt, and \"Jotaro\" by Phiso.[122][126] Some commentators have suggested that Riddim is not a genre in its own right and is instead just a style of dubstep. Riddim producer Oolacile states \"A lot of people who have been around a lot longer have a different idea of what riddim is. Older fans consider riddim to be the swampy, repetitive sound, and newer fans will associate riddim with the sound of the underground.\"[122] Beginning in mid-2014, dubstep began to decline drastically in mainstream popularity, particularly in the United States, where many formerly successful dubstep artists became popular. Artists such as Skrillex, for instance, moved on to producing tracks for trap and pop artists,[127][128][129] while artists such as Mount Kimbie and James Blake shifted their sounds from post-dubstep into more experimental or soulful electronic influenced music.[130][131] Pioneers of dubstep such as Skream and Loefah moved away from the genre, moving on to other genres instead. Loefah stopped playing and producing dubstep and moved on to UK bass, founding his record label Swamp81 in the process.[132] Skream shifted away from dubstep, choosing to instead produce and play house and techno music in his DJ sets and releasing various techno songs on Alan Fitzpatrick's record label We Are The Brave.[133][134] Around the early to mid 2010s, a niche development of dubstep began to emerge which combines the aggression and impact of brostep with the rich tonality and musicality of melodic dubstep,[135] drawing on the best elements of both sides and fusing tonality with mid-range bass sound design.[136][137] Artists like 501, Subscape, and Gemini have experimented upon this style of production in the earlier 2010s.[135] English dubstep producer Chime coined the term \"colour bass\" describing this style of dubstep due to its focus on vibrant, bright and colourful production, and founded the record label Rushdown in 2016 to promote it.[135][137] Despite the overall declining popularity of dubstep in mainstream culture, colour bass has been promoted by veteran electronic labels like Monstercat around the early 2020s,[135][138][139][140] with artists like Skybreak, Ace Aura, and Chime himself finding success in producing colour bass music.[141][142]"], "reference": "According to a BBC review, Rusko attempted to realign his music with a \"Jamaican inheritance\" and distance it from the \"belching, aggressive, resolutely macho\" dubstep produced by his contemporaries.

BBC Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson named it his record of 2007, and it was also a massive hit in the equally bassline-orientated, but decidedly more four-to-the-floor genre of bassline house,[65] whilst Burial's late 2007 release Untrue (which was nominated for the 2008 Nationwide Mercury Music Prize in the UK) incorporated extensive use of heavily manipulated, mostly female, 'girl next door' vocal samples.[66] Burial has spoken at length regarding his intent to reincorporate elements of musical precursors such as 2-step garage and house into his sound.[67] Much like drum and bass before it, dubstep started to become incorporated into other media. In 2007, Benga, Skream, and other dubstep producers provided the soundtrack to much of the second series of Dubplate Drama, which aired on Channel 4 with a soundtrack CD later released on Rinse Recordings. A track by Skream also featured in the second series of the teen drama Skins, which also aired on Channel 4 in early 2008.[68] In the summer of 2008, Mary Anne Hobbs invited Cyrus, Starkey, Oneman, DJ Chef, Silkie, Quest, Joker, Nomad, Kulture and MC Sgt Pokes to the BBC's Maida Vale studios for a show called Generation Bass.

The tempo is nearly always in the range of 132–142 beats per minute, with a clap or snare usually inserted every third beat in a bar. With a large majority of releases at 140bpm, the genre (as well as others, including grime) is sometimes referred to as \"140\".[15] In its early stages, dubstep was often more percussive, with more influences from two‑step drum patterns. Many producers were also experimenting with tribal drum samples, such as Loefah's early release \"Truly Dread\" and Mala's \"Anti-War Dub\". In an Invisible Jukebox interview with The Wire, Kode9 commented on a MRK1 track, observing that listeners \"have internalized the double-time rhythm\" and the \"track is so empty it makes [the listener] nervous, and you almost fill in the double time yourself, physically, to compensate\".[18] One characteristic of certain strands of dubstep is the wobble bass, often referred to as the \"wub\", where an extended bass note is manipulated rhythmically. This style of bass is typically produced by using a low-frequency oscillator to manipulate certain parameters of a synthesiser such as volume, distortion or filter cutoff. The resulting sound is a timbre that is punctuated by rhythmic variations in volume, filter cutoff, or distortion. This style of bass is a driving factor in some variations of dubstep, particularly at the more club-friendly end of the spectrum.[19] Wobble bass has been nicknamed Wobble-step.[20] Originally, dubstep releases had some structural similarities to other genres like drum and bass and UK garage. Typically, this would comprise an intro, a main section (often incorporating a bass drop), a midsection, a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an outro. Many early dubstep tracks incorporate one or more \"bass drops\", a characteristic inherited from drum and bass. Typically, the percussion will pause, often reducing the track to silence, and then resume with more intensity, accompanied by a dominant sub-bass. It is very common for the bass to drop either after the 16th or 32nd measure of a song. However, this (or the existence of a bass drop in general) is by no means a completely rigid characteristic, rather a trope; a large portion of seminal tunes from producers like Kode9 and Horsepower Productions have more experimental song structures which do not rely on a drop for a dynamic peak – and in some instances do not feature a bass drop at all.", "<2-hop>\n\nwith Kode9, Loefah, and Digital Mystikz appearing on the second.[46] These compilations helped to raise awareness of dubstep at a time when the grime sound was drawing more attention,[30] and Digital Mystikz and Loefah's presence on the second release contributed to the success of their DMZ club night.[47] Soon afterwards, the Independent on Sunday commented on \"a whole new sound\", at a time when both genres were becoming popular, stating that \"grime\" and \"dubstep\" were two names for the same style, which was also known as \"sublow\", \"8-bar\", and \"eskibeat\".[48] In the summer of 2005, Forward>> brought grime DJs to the fore of the line up.[49] Building on the success of Skream's grimey anthem \"Midnight Request Line\", the hype around the DMZ night and support from online forums (notably dubstepforum.com)[15] and media,[9] the scene gained prominence after Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs gathered top figures from the scene for one show, entitled \"Dubstep Warz\", (later releasing the compilation album Warrior Dubz).[42] The show created a new global audience for the scene, after years of exclusively UK underground buzz.[15] Burial's self-titled album appearing in many critics' \"Best of ...\" lists for the year, notably The Wire's Best Album of 2006.[50] The sound was also featured prominently in the soundtrack for the 2006 sci-fi film Children of Men,[51] which included Digital Mystikz, Random Trio, Kode 9, Pressure and DJ Pinch.[52] Ammunition also released the first retrospective compilation of the 2000–2004 era of dubstep called The Roots of Dubstep, co-compiled by Ammunition and Blackdown on the Tempa Label.[53] The sound's first North American ambassador, Baltimore DJ Joe Nice helped kickstart its spread into the continent.[15] Regular Dubstep club nights started appearing in cities like New York,[54] San Francisco,[33] Seattle, Montreal, Houston, and Denver,[55] while Mary Anne Hobbs curated a Dubstep showcase at 2007's Sónar festival in Barcelona.[17] Non-British artists have also won praise within the larger Dubstep community.[17] The dynamic dubstep scene in Japan is growing quickly despite its cultural and geographical distance from the West.
