Can you tell me about the origins and evolution of chill-out music?", "reference_contexts": ["Chill-out (shortened as chill; also typeset as chillout or chill out) is a loosely defined form of popular music characterized by slow tempos and relaxed moods.[1][2] The definition of \"chill-out music\" has evolved throughout the decades, and generally refers to anything that might be identified as a modern type of easy listening.\n\nThe term \"chill-out music\" – originally conflated with \"ambient house\" – came from an area called \"The White Room\" at the Heaven nightclub in London in 1989. There, DJs played ambient mixes from sources such as Brian Eno and Pink Floyd to allow dancers a place to \"chill out\" from the faster-paced music of the main dance floor. Ambient house became widely popular over the next decade before it declined due to market saturation.\n\nIn the early 2000s, DJs in Ibiza's Café Del Mar began creating ambient house mixes that drew on jazz, classical, Hispanic, and New Age sources. The popularity of chill-out subsequently expanded to dedicated satellite radio channels, outdoor festivals, and thousands of compilation albums. \"Chill-out\" was also removed from its ambient origins and became its own distinct genre.\n\nThere is no exact definition of chill-out music.[1][3] The term, which has evolved throughout the decades, generally refers to anything that might be identified as a modern type of easy listening. Some of the genres associated with \"chill\" include downtempo, classical, dance, jazz, hip hop, world, pop, lounge, and ambient.[1] Chill-out typically has slow rhythms,  sampling, a \"trance-like nature\", \"drop-out beats\", and a mixture of electronic instruments with acoustic instruments. In the \"Ambient/Chill Out\" chapter of Rick Snoman's 2013 book Dance Music Manual, he writes, \"it could be said that as long as the tempo remains below 120 BPM and it employs a laid-back groove, it could be classed as chill out.\"[3]\n\nThe term originated from an area called \"The White Room\" at the Heaven nightclub in London in 1989.[4] Its DJs were Jimmy Cauty and Alex Paterson, later of the Orb.[5] They created ambient mixes from sources such as Brian Eno, Pink Floyd, the Eagles, Mike Oldfield, 10cc, and War. The room's purpose was to allow dancers a chance to \"chill out\" from the more emphatic and fast-tempo music played on the main dance floor. This also coincided with the short-lived fad of ambient house, also known as \"New Age house\".  Cauty's KLF subsequently released an album called Chill Out (February 1990), featuring uncredited contributions from Paterson.[4] In addition, during the early 1990s, the Beach Boys' Smiley Smile (1967) was reputed as one of the best \"chill-out\" albums to listen to during an LSD comedown.[6]\n\nAmbient house declined after the mid-1990s due to market saturation.[7] In the early 2000s, DJs in Ibiza's Café Del Mar began creating ambient house mixes that drew on jazz, classical, Hispanic, and New Age sources. They called their product \"chill-out music\", and it sparked a revived interest in ambient house from the public and record labels.[7] The popularity of chill-out subsequently expanded to dedicated satellite radio channels, outdoor festivals, and the release of thousands of compilation albums offering ambient sounds and \"muffled\" beats.[1] Consequently, the popular understanding of \"chill-out music\" shifted away from \"ambient\" and into its own distinct genre.[7] Music critics to that point were generally dismissive of the music.[1]\n\nStreaming became the dominant source of music industry revenue in 2016.[8] During that decade, Spotify engendered a trend that became known among the industry as \"lean back listening\", which refers to a listener who \"thinks less about the artist or album they are seeking out, and instead connects with emotions, moods, and activities\". As of 2017, the front page of the service's \"browse\" screen included many algorithmically-selected playlists with names such as \"Chilled Folk\", \"Chill Hits\", \"Evening Chill\", \"Chilled R&B\", \"Indie Chillout\", and \"Chill Tracks\".[9] In 2014, the service reported that throughout the year \"Chill Out\" playlists had trended much higher than the national average on campuses across Colorado, where marijuana had been legalized in January of that year.[10] In an editorial piece for The Baffler titled \"The Problem with Muzak\", writer Liz Pelly criticized the \"chill\" playlists as \"the purest distillation of [Spotify's] ambition to turn all music into emotional wallpaper\".[9]\n\nIn 2009, a genre called \"chillwave\" was invented by the satirical blog Hipster Runoff for music that could already be described with existing labels such as dream pop.[11][12] The pseudonymous author, known as \"Carles\", later explained that he was only \"[throwing] a bunch of pretty silly names on a blog post and saw which one stuck.\"[13] Chillwave became one of the first genres to acquire an identity online,[14] although the term did not gain mainstream currency until early 2010, when it was the subject of serious, analytical articles by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.[15]  In 2011, Carles said it was \"ridiculous that any sort of press took it seriously\" and that although the bands he spoke to \"get annoyed\" by the tag, \"they understand that it's been a good thing. What about iTunes making it an official genre? It's now theoretically a marketable indie sound.\"[13]\n\nIn 2013, YouTube began allowing its users to host live streams, which resulted in a host of 24-hour \"radio stations\" dedicated to microgenres such as vaporwave,[16] a derivation of chillwave.[17]  Music streaming platform Spotify added to the popular \"lo-fi beats\" wave by generating \"Spotified genres\", including \"Chill Hits\", \"Bedroom Pop\" playlists, and promoting numerous \"chill pop\" artists.[18] In 2017, a form of downtempo music tagged as \"chillhop\" or \"lo-fi hip hop\" became popular among YouTube music streamers. By 2018, several of these channels had attracted millions of followers[19] and Spotify's \"Chill Hits\" playlist had 5.4 million listeners.[18]"], "reference": "The term \\\"chill-out music\\\" originated from an area called \\\"The White Room\\\" at the Heaven nightclub in London in 1989, where DJs played ambient mixes to allow dancers a place to \\\"chill out\\\" from faster-paced music.

Songs are usually classified as speedcore at around 300+ beats per minute (BPM), but this can vary.[3]\n\nAside from the very fast tempo, speedcore can often be distinguished from other forms of hardcore by an aggressive and overridden electronic percussion track that is often punctuated with a hyperactive snare or tom-tom fills. Most producers will overdrive their kicks so far that they become square waves.[4] Speedcore DJs often use violent, vulgar, and offensive themes in their music to push the boundaries of the genre.[5]\n\nSince the 2000s, the use of digital audio workstations (DAWs) has grown versus the use of analog synthesizers or trackers.[4]\n\nSpeedcore is a natural progression of hardcore techno. Hardcore was already considered fast, however, there were those who were not content to stay at the established speed. Early speedcore was about pushing the limits of BPM and aggression level. One of the first songs to explore higher speeds was \"Thousand\" by Moby in 1992, which peaked at approximately 1,015 BPM.[6][5]\n\nThe term speedcore in reference to high tempo hardcore/gabber can be traced as far back as 1995.[7][8] Disciples Of Annihilation coined the name of the genre with their track \"NYC Speedcore\".[4] Belgian artist DJ Einrich refined the sound in the late 1990s, using oscillators to transform fast kick drums into notes in octaves.[5]\n\nIt was not until the early 2000s that the genre was commonly referred to as speedcore. Before then, many tracks that would be considered speedcore were referred to as \"gabba\".[9][10]\n\nThe early 2000s saw the birth of many netlabels dedicated to speedcore. Many labels who produced vinyl were also publishing MP3 files on their websites, which became increasingly popular and made it easier for new producers to enter the scene.\n\nThe 2010s saw a large growth in netlabels. DAWs made it cheaper and easier for new musicians to make experimental music. The internet allowed producers from around the world to communicate with each other and share their works through netlabels. Compilation albums became very popular for artists to share their music as they could get more exposure than by themselves. A large portion of the speedcore scene now occurs online from netlabels to speedcore promotion channels on YouTube. Speedcore was no longer restrained to localized areas where raves occurred and records were released.\n\nSpeedcore is often called splittercore when the BPM count is between 600 and 1,000.[5] Splittercore is identified by its minigun sounding kicks. In the 1990s splittercore was sometimes referred to as nosebleed techno.[4]\n\nFlashcore is a genre that grew out of speedcore and industrial hardcore. While being originally related to speedcore, flashcore is defined by its complex avant-garde structures and abstract sounds, making it more similar to electroacoustic music and experimental music rather than any EDM genre. Most of the genre's works focus on intense, rhythmic, and layered soundscapes.[11]\n\nSongs with a BPM of 1,000 or higher are known as extratone songs. At this tempo, the kicks happen so fast that the beat sounds like one constant note with a shifting pitch; extratone often has sudden increases or decreases in tempo to change the pitch of the tone.
