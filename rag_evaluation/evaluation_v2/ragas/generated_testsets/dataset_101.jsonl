It developed in the Southern United States from rock and roll, country and blues, and is focused generally on electric guitars and vocals. Rock music's origins lie mostly in the music of the American South, and many stars from the first wave of 1950s rock and roll such as Bo Diddley, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, Fats Domino, and Jerry Lee Lewis hailed from the Deep South. However, the British Invasion and the rise of folk rock and psychedelic rock in the middle 1960s shifted the focus of new rock music away from the rural south and to large cities like Liverpool, London, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. In the 1960s, rock musician Lonnie Mack blended black and white roots-music genres within the framework of rock, beginning with the hit song \"Memphis\" in 1963.[1] Music historian Dick Shurman considers Mack's recordings from that era \"a prototype of what later could be called Southern rock\".[2] The Allman Brothers Band, from Jacksonville, Florida, made their national debut in 1969 and soon gained a loyal following. Duane Allman's playing on the two Hour Glass albums and an Hour Glass session in early 1968 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama had caught the ear of Rick Hall, owner of FAME.[3] In November 1968, Hall hired Allman to play on an album with Wilson Pickett. Allman's work on that album, Hey Jude (1968), got him hired as a full-time session musician at Muscle Shoals and brought him to the attention of a number of other musicians, such as Eric Clapton, who later related how he heard Pickett's version of \"Hey Jude\" on his car radio and called Atlantic Records to find out who the guitarist was: \"To this day,\" Clapton said, \"I've never heard better rock guitar playing on an R&B record.

Charlie Daniels' self-titled debut album, released in 1970, was a pivotal recording in the development of the Southern rock genre, \"because it points the way to how the genre could and would sound, and how country music could retain its hillbilly spirit and rock like a mother,\" according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine.[12] Erlewine described Daniels as \"a redneck rebel, not fitting into either the country or the rock & roll [...] but, in retrospect, he sounds like a visionary, pointing the way to the future when southern rockers saw no dividing lines between rock, country, and blues, and only saw it all as sons of the south.\"[13] Daniels later formed the Charlie Daniels Band, a group which fused rock, country, blues, and jazz.

Their self-titled album, released in 1973, included the hit \"Can't You See\". Perhaps known best for the single \"Fire on the Mountain,\" the Marshall Tucker Band hit \"Heard it in a Love Song\" charted in 1977. Lynyrd Skynyrd played British hard rock influenced music until the deaths of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant and two other members of the group in a 1977 airplane crash.[16] After this tragic plane crash, members Allen Collins and Gary Rossington started the Rossington Collins Band.[17] By the beginning of the 1980s, the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd had disbanded, and Capricorn Records had gone bankrupt. Leading acts of the genre (in particular, 38 Special) had become enmeshed in arena rock.
