She argues that the loudness is designed to \"sweep the listener into the sound\" and to provide a \"shot of youthful vitality\".[11] Heavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male[32] until at least the mid-1980s,[33] with some exceptions such as Girlschool.[32] However, by the 2010s, women were making more of an impact,[34][35] and PopMatters' Craig Hayes argues that metal \"clearly empowers women\".[36] In the power metal and symphonic metal subgenres, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers, such as Nightwish, Delain and Within Temptation. The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".[22] In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures – generally made up of eighth or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.[37] Brief, abrupt and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".[22] By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos, and as recently as the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).[27] One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord.[38] In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low-frequency sounds are created, which add to the \"weight of the sound\" and create an effect of \"overwhelming power\".[39] Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,[40] power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth or minor sixth.[41] Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.[42] Heavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes.[43] Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.[44][45] In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \"pentatonic and blues-derived features\".[46] The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones – such as C to F# – was considered extremely dissonant and unstable by medieval and Renaissance music theorists. It was nicknamed the diabolus in musica – \"the devil in music\".[47] Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.[48] According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\".[49] In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized.[46] Robert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \"assemblage of disparate musical styles known ... as 'classical music'\" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days, and that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.\"[50] In an article written for Grove Music Online, Walser stated that the \"1980s brought on ... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen.\"[51] Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that \"if done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together.

An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music.'\"[53] According to David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music.\" They take as an example Black Sabbath's second album, Paranoid (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma—'Paranoid' and 'Fairies Wear Boots' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory 'War Pigs' and 'Hand of Doom.'\"[54] Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic – a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.[55] The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, \"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.\"[8] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others[56] have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs.[57] Andrew Cope stated that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are \"clearly misguided\" as these critics have \"overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise\".[58] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal \"an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat\".[59] Heavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song \"Under the Blade\" at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery.[60] In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song \"Suicide Solution\".[61] A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne's song. Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen's death.[62] In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement \"do it\" in the band's cover of the song \"Better by You, Better than Me\".[63] While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed.[57] In 1991, U.K. police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an \"unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity\".[64] In some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values, and in countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated.[65] In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans, and they were accused of \"devil worship\" and blasphemy after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes.[64] In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the \"band's lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive\" and blasphemous.[66] Some people consider heavy metal music to be a leading factor for mental health disorders, and that heavy metal fans are more likely to suffer poor mental health, but a study from 2009 suggests that this is not true and that fans of heavy metal music suffer from poor mental health at a similar or lower rate compared to the general population.[67] For many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments and music videos.[68] Down-the-back long hair is the \"most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion\".[69] Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s, heavy metal hair \"symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home\", according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community \"the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general\".[70] The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light-colored, ripped, frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets. Deena Weinstein wrote, \"T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.\"[71] In the 1980s, a range of sources – from punk rock and goth music to horror films – influenced metal fashion.[72] Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.[73][74] Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname \"hair metal\"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.[73] Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei, which includes many non-metal groups, emphasize elaborate costumes, hair and makeup.[75] When performing live, many metal musicians – as well as the audience for whom they're playing – engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often"], "reference": "Walser linked heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "What hand gesture was popularized by Dio?", "reference_contexts": ["emphasized by long hair. The il cornuto, or \"devil horns\", hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio during his time with the bands Black Sabbath and Dio.[45] Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.[76] Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and \"extreme heterosexualist ideology\". Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.[77] The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.[78] According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which \"were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture\".[79] Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the \"pit\" near the stage. Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump \"back into the audience\".[79] It has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary and strongly masculine subculture.[80] While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male and blue-collar, the group is \"tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior\".[81] Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.[82] Attending live concerts in particular has been called the \"holiest of heavy metal communions\".[83] The metal scene has been characterized as a \"subculture of alienation\" with its own code of authenticity.[84] This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never \"sell out\".[85] Deena Weinstein stated that for the fans themselves, the code promotes \"opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society\".[86] Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observed, \"Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with\" and that metal is \"outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place.\"[87] Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as \"poseurs\" \"who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity\".[84][88] The origin of the term \"heavy metal\" in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1961 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as \"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\". Burroughs' next novel, Nova Express (1964), develops the theme, using \"heavy metal\" as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music.\"[89] Inspired by Burroughs' novels,[90] the term was used in the title of the 1967 album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music.[91] The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe the Byrds for their supposed \"aluminium style of context and effect\", particularly on their album The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968).[92] Metal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in \"hippiespeak\": \"heavy\" is roughly synonymous with \"potent\" or \"profound\", and \"metal\" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.[93] The word \"heavy\" in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to \"heavy music\" – typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare – were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge. Iron Butterfly's debut album, which was released in early 1968, was titled Heavy. The first use of \"heavy metal\" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song \"Born to Be Wild\", also released that year:[94] \"I like smoke and lightning / Heavy metal thunder / Racin' with the wind / And the feelin' that I'm under\". An early documented use of the phrase in rock criticism appears in Sandy Pearlman's February 1967 Crawdaddy review of the Rolling Stones' Got Live If You Want It (1966), albeit as a description of the sound rather than as a genre: \"On this album the Stones go metal. Technology is in the saddle—as an ideal and as a method.\"[95][nb 1] Another appears in the 11 May 1968 issue of Rolling Stone, in which Barry Gifford wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: \"Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.\"[97] In the 7 September 1968 edition of the Seattle Daily Times, reviewer Susan Schwartz wrote that the Jimi Hendrix Experience \"has a heavy-metals blues sound\".[98] In January 1970, Lucian K.

In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers – British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple – were founded.[3] Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen.[4] During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence,[5][6] while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\". The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and machismo,[7] an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny. During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Poison. Meanwhile, however, underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and black metal became – and remain – subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal and nu metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip-hop. Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter or omit one or more of these attributes. In a 1988 article, The New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote, \"In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.\"[8] The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.[9] Deep Purple's Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ. In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on Led Zeppelin III; by the 1990s, synthesizers were used in \"almost every subgenre of heavy metal\".[10] The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.[11] The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy fuzz.[12] For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the \"punch and grind\" characteristic.[13] Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with multiple bass frequencies.[13] Guitar solos are \"an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar\" to the genre.[14] Most heavy metal songs \"feature at least one guitar solo\",[15] which is \"a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\".[16] Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.[17] With rhythm guitar parts, the \"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal ... [is created by] palm muting\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.[18] Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.[19] The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional \"frontman\" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two \"contend for dominance\" in a spirit of \"affectionate rivalry\".[9] Heavy metal \"demands the subordination of the voice\" to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an \"explicit display of emotion\" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.[20] Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's \"tone of voice\" is more important than the lyrics.[21] The prominent role of the bass ‍is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \"heavy\".[22] The bass plays a \"more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock\".[23] Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass ‍solos and use of chords while playing the ‍bass in the early 1980s.[24] Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines.[25] Heavy metal drumming is defined by a loud, consistent beat that drives the band, relying on the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision.\"[26] Heavy metal drumming \"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\", and drummers have to develop \"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns\" used in heavy metal.[27] A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.[22] Black metal, death metal and some \"mainstream metal\" bands \"all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats\".[28] In live performance, loudness – an \"onslaught of sound\", in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description – is considered vital.[11] In his book, Metalheads, psychologist", "<2-hop>\n\nJeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as \"the sensory equivalent of war\".[29] Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \"All we knew was we wanted more power.\"[30] A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how \"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact\".[31] Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre and volume are the key elements of metal.

The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".[22] In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures – generally made up of eighth or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.[37] Brief, abrupt and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads.

The spelling tekno is deliberately used to differentiate the musical style from techno. The music is fast and it can vary between 150 and 185 bpm and is characterised by a pounding repetitive kick drum.[1] Nevertheless, bass drum distortion by clipping is used less often as in the related genre of mainstyle hardcore. Nowadays, some tekno producers also use drum sets that rather sound trancey, since many members of the tekno subculture as well as the psytrance subculture frequently attend the same raves and the two scenes are closely connected. Tekk/Tekke is mainly produced in Germany and often remixes quotes or audio clips. As dance music, tekkno was unusually rhythm-oriented for the time.[2] Therefore, this term also became synonymous with particularly hard dance music.[2] At times, the number of the letter \"k\" was used to advertise the supposed hardness of the sound at parties and compilations (Tekno, Tekkno, Tekkkno...).

{"user_input": "What does Weinstein say about moshing and the heavy metal subculture?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\ndeliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".[22] In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures – generally made up of eighth or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.[37] Brief, abrupt and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".[22] By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos, and as recently as the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).[27] One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord.[38] In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low-frequency sounds are created, which add to the \"weight of the sound\" and create an effect of \"overwhelming power\".[39] Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,[40] power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth or minor sixth.[41] Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.[42] Heavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes.[43] Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.[44][45] In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \"pentatonic and blues-derived features\".[46] The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones – such as C to F# – was considered extremely dissonant and unstable by medieval and Renaissance music theorists. It was nicknamed the diabolus in musica – \"the devil in music\".[47] Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.[48] According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\".[49] In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized.[46] Robert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \"assemblage of disparate musical styles known ... as 'classical music'\" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days, and that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.\"[50] In an article written for Grove Music Online, Walser stated that the \"1980s brought on ... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen.\"[51] Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that \"if done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together. Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.\"[52] Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices – classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition. As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note: \"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions.' An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music.'\"[53] According to David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music.\" They take as an example Black Sabbath's second album, Paranoid (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma—'Paranoid' and 'Fairies Wear Boots' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory 'War Pigs' and 'Hand of Doom.'\"[54] Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic – a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.[55] The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, \"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ...", "<2-hop>\n\ndiving, which \"were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture\".[79] Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the \"pit\" near the stage. Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump \"back into the audience\".[79] It has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary and strongly masculine subculture.[80] While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male and blue-collar, the group is \"tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior\".[81] Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.[82] Attending live concerts in particular has been called the \"holiest of heavy metal communions\".[83] The metal scene has been characterized as a \"subculture of alienation\" with its own code of authenticity.[84] This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never \"sell out\".[85] Deena Weinstein stated that for the fans themselves, the code promotes \"opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society\".[86] Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observed, \"Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with\" and that metal is \"outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place.\"[87] Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as \"poseurs\" \"who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity\".[84][88] The origin of the term \"heavy metal\" in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1961 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as \"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\". Burroughs' next novel, Nova Express (1964), develops the theme, using \"heavy metal\" as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music.\"[89] Inspired by Burroughs' novels,[90] the term was used in the title of the 1967 album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music.[91] The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe the Byrds for their supposed \"aluminium style of context and effect\", particularly on their album The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968).[92] Metal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in \"hippiespeak\": \"heavy\" is roughly synonymous with \"potent\" or \"profound\", and \"metal\" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.[93] The word \"heavy\" in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to \"heavy music\" – typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare – were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge. Iron Butterfly's debut album, which was released in early 1968, was titled Heavy. The first use of \"heavy metal\" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song \"Born to Be Wild\", also released that year:[94] \"I like smoke and lightning / Heavy metal thunder / Racin' with the wind / And the feelin' that I'm under\". An early documented use of the phrase in rock criticism appears in Sandy Pearlman's February 1967 Crawdaddy review of the Rolling Stones' Got Live If You Want It (1966), albeit as a description of the sound rather than as a genre: \"On this album the Stones go metal. Technology is in the saddle—as an ideal and as a method.\"[95][nb 1] Another appears in the 11 May 1968 issue of Rolling Stone, in which Barry Gifford wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: \"Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.\"[97] In the 7 September 1968 edition of the Seattle Daily Times, reviewer Susan Schwartz wrote that the Jimi Hendrix Experience \"has a heavy-metals blues sound\".[98] In January 1970, Lucian K. Truscott IV, reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice, described the sound as \"heavy\" and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.[99] Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic Metal Mike Saunders. In the 12 November 1970 issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: \"Safe as Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs ... and one monumental pile of refuse.\" He described the band's latest, self-titled release as \"more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap\".[100] In a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come in the May 1971 edition of Creem, Saunders wrote, \"Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best"], "reference": "Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other in a circle near the stage, and stage divers climb onto the stage and jump back into the audience.

In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers – British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple – were founded.[3] Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen.[4] During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence,[5][6] while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\". The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and machismo,[7] an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny. During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Poison. Meanwhile, however, underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and black metal became – and remain – subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal and nu metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip-hop. Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter or omit one or more of these attributes. In a 1988 article, The New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote, \"In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.\"[8] The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.[9] Deep Purple's Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ. In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on Led Zeppelin III; by the 1990s, synthesizers were used in \"almost every subgenre of heavy metal\".[10] The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.[11] The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy fuzz.[12] For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the \"punch and grind\" characteristic.[13] Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with multiple bass frequencies.[13] Guitar solos are \"an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar\" to the genre.[14] Most heavy metal songs \"feature at least one guitar solo\",[15] which is \"a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\".[16] Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.[17] With rhythm guitar parts, the \"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal ... [is created by] palm muting\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.[18] Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.[19] The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional \"frontman\" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two \"contend for dominance\" in a spirit of \"affectionate rivalry\".[9] Heavy metal \"demands the subordination of the voice\" to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an \"explicit display of emotion\" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.[20] Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's \"tone of voice\" is more important than the lyrics.[21] The prominent role of the bass ‍is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \"heavy\".[22] The bass plays a \"more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock\".[23] Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass ‍solos and use of chords while playing the ‍bass in the early 1980s.[24] Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines.[25] Heavy metal drumming is defined by a loud, consistent beat that drives the band, relying on the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision.\"[26] Heavy metal drumming \"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\", and drummers have to develop \"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns\" used in heavy metal.[27] A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.[22] Black metal, death metal and some \"mainstream metal\" bands \"all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats\".[28] In live performance, loudness – an \"onslaught of sound\", in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description – is considered vital.[11] In his book, Metalheads, psychologist", "<2-hop>\n\nout cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.[185] Motörhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music magazines such as the NME and Sounds took notice, with Sounds writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\".[186] NWOBHM bands including Iron Maiden, Saxon and Def Leppard re-energized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.[187] \"This seemed to be the resurgence of heavy metal,\" noted Ronnie James Dio, who joined Black Sabbath in 1979. \"I've never thought there was a desurgence of heavy metal – if that's a word! – but it was important to me that, yet again [after Rainbow], I could be involved in something that was paving the way for those who are going to come after me.\"[188] By 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a significant influence on metal's development.[189] In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the U.K. charts with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.[190] The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple broke up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin split following drummer John Bonham's death in 1980. Black Sabbath were plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition from their opening band, Van Halen.[191][192] Eddie Van Halen established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era. His solo on \"Eruption\", from the band's self-titled 1978 album, is considered a milestone.[193] Eddie Van Halen's sound even crossed over into pop music when his guitar solo was featured on the track \"Beat It\" by Michael Jackson, which reached No. 1 in the U.S. in February 1983.[194] Inspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s. Based on the clubs of L.A.'s Sunset Strip, bands such as Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Ratt and W.A.S.P. were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the 1970s.[195] These acts incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of glam metal or \"hair metal\" bands such as Alice Cooper and Kiss.[196] Glam metal bands were often visually distinguished by long, overworked hairstyles accompanied by wardrobes which were sometimes considered cross-gender. The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior, including lyrics that involved sexual expletives and the use of narcotics.[197] In the wake of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough with British Steel (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981; sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel.[198] Def Leppard's videos for Pyromania (1983) made them superstars in America, and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the Billboard chart with Metal Health (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the \"heavy metal day\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.[199] Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal's share of all recordings sold in the U.S. increased from 8% to 20%.[200] Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including Kerrang! in 1981 and Metal Hammer in 1984, as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, Billboard declared: \"Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female.\"[201] By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, music television and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.'s Warrant and acts from the East Coast like Poison and Cinderella became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, New Jersey's Bon Jovi became enormously successful with its third album, Slippery When Wet (1986). The similarly styled Swedish band Europe became international stars with The Final Countdown (1986), whose title track hit No. 1 in 25 countries.[202] In 1987, MTV launched Headbangers Ball, a show devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as \"light metal\" or \"hair metal\".[203] One band that reached diverse audiences was Guns N' Roses. With the release of their chart-topping album Appetite for Destruction in 1987, they \"recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years\".[204] The following year, Jane's Addiction emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with their major-label debut, Nothing's Shocking. Reviewing the album, Steve Pond of Rolling Stone declared, \"As much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin.\"[205] The group was one of the first to be identified with the \"alternative metal\" trend that would come to the fore in the next decade. Meanwhile, new bands like New York City's Winger and New Jersey's Skid Row sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.[206] Many subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s,[207] such as crossover thrash. Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.[208] In 1990, a review"], "reference": "Judas Priest helped spur the evolution of heavy metal by discarding much of its blues influence.

{"user_input": "According to PopMatters, how has the role of women in heavy metal evolved since the 1980s, and what subgenres feature female lead singers?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nJeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as \"the sensory equivalent of war\".[29] Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \"All we knew was we wanted more power.\"[30] A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how \"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact\".[31] Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to \"sweep the listener into the sound\" and to provide a \"shot of youthful vitality\".[11] Heavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male[32] until at least the mid-1980s,[33] with some exceptions such as Girlschool.[32] However, by the 2010s, women were making more of an impact,[34][35] and PopMatters' Craig Hayes argues that metal \"clearly empowers women\".[36] In the power metal and symphonic metal subgenres, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers, such as Nightwish, Delain and Within Temptation. The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".[22] In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures – generally made up of eighth or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.[37] Brief, abrupt and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".[22] By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos, and as recently as the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).[27] One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord.[38] In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low-frequency sounds are created, which add to the \"weight of the sound\" and create an effect of \"overwhelming power\".[39] Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,[40] power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth or minor sixth.[41] Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.[42] Heavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes.[43] Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.[44][45] In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \"pentatonic and blues-derived features\".[46] The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones – such as C to F# – was considered extremely dissonant and unstable by medieval and Renaissance music theorists. It was nicknamed the diabolus in musica – \"the devil in music\".[47] Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.[48] According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\".[49] In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized.[46] Robert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \"assemblage of disparate musical styles known ... as 'classical music'\" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days, and that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.\"[50] In an article written for Grove Music Online, Walser stated that the \"1980s brought on ... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen.\"[51] Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that \"if done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together. Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.\"[52] Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices – classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition.

However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music.'\"[53] According to David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music.\" They take as an example Black Sabbath's second album, Paranoid (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma—'Paranoid' and 'Fairies Wear Boots' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory 'War Pigs' and 'Hand of Doom.'\"[54] Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic – a thread running from"], "reference": "According to PopMatters' Craig Hayes, metal \"clearly empowers women\".

Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice,[183] but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, Robert Christgau described it as \"dull and decadent ... dim-witted, amoral exploitation.\"[184] Punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, disco and more mainstream rock.[183] With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and \"lo-fi\", do it yourself ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.[185] Motörhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music magazines such as the NME and Sounds took notice, with Sounds writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the \" ", "<2-hop>\n\nLed Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.[55] The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, \"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.\"[8] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others[56] have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs.[57] Andrew Cope stated that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are \"clearly misguided\" as these critics have \"overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise\".[58] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal \"an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat\".[59] Heavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song \"Under the Blade\" at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery.[60] In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song \"Suicide Solution\".[61] A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne's song. Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen's death.[62] In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement \"do it\" in the band's cover of the song \"Better by You, Better than Me\".[63] While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed.[57] In 1991, U.K. police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an \"unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity\".[64] In some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values, and in countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated.[65] In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans, and they were accused of \"devil worship\" and blasphemy after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes.[64] In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the \"band's lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive\" and blasphemous.[66] Some people consider heavy metal music to be a leading factor for mental health disorders, and that heavy metal fans are more likely to suffer poor mental health, but a study from 2009 suggests that this is not true and that fans of heavy metal music suffer from poor mental health at a similar or lower rate compared to the general population.[67] For many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments and music videos.[68] Down-the-back long hair is the \"most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion\".[69] Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s, heavy metal hair \"symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home\", according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community \"the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general\".[70] The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light-colored, ripped, frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets. Deena Weinstein wrote, \"T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.\"[71] In the 1980s, a range of sources – from punk rock and goth music to horror films – influenced metal fashion.[72] Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.[73][74] Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname \"hair metal\"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.[73] Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei, which includes many non-metal groups, emphasize elaborate costumes, hair and makeup.[75] When performing live, many metal musicians – as well as the audience for whom they're playing – engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The il cornuto, or \"devil horns\", hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio during his time with the bands Black Sabbath and Dio.[45] Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.[76] Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and \"extreme heterosexualist ideology\". Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.[77] The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.[78] According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage"], "reference": "In the early 1970s, Robert Christgau described a Black Sabbath album as \"dull and decadent ... dim-witted, amoral exploitation.\" Punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal, leading to a sharp decline in heavy metal record sales in the late 1970s.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer"}
