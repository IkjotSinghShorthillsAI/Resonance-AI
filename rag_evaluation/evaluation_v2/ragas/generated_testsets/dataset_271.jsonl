{"user_input": "As a DJ and producer always looking for the roots and future of house music, can you elaborate on the contributions of Hopeton \\\"Scientist\\\" Brown to the development and pioneering of dub music, and how his work might have influenced later genres like house?", "reference_contexts": ["Dub is a musical style that grew out of reggae in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style.[1] Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings[2] created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, emphasis of the rhythm section (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a riddim), the application of studio effects such as echo and reverb, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.[3] Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock, Hopeton \"Scientist\" Brown, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others[1] beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy.[4] These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.[5] Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk,[6] pop,[7] hip hop,[6] post-disco, and later house,[8] techno,[8] ambient,[8] electronic dance music,[9] and trip hop.[8] Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass, as well as a major influence on dubstep, with its orientation around bass and utilization of audio effects.[10][11][12] Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material. The use of the word dub in a recording context originated in the late 1920s with the advent of \"talking pictures\" and referred to adding a soundtrack to a film; it is an informal abbreviation of the word double. Over the next 40 years or so the term found its way into audio recording in general, often in the context of making a copy of a recording on another tape or disc. It was in this sense that the term was first used in the Jamaican recording industry: new recordings were often initially copied onto one-off acetate discs, known colloquially as soft wax[13] or dub and later as dubplates, for exclusive use by sound system operators; playing a song as an exclusive recording on a sound system was a good way for a producer to test the potential popularity of a recording before committing to the pressing of hundreds or thousands of copies of singles for retail sale. Initially, these acetates would simply be the standard recording of a song that was yet to be released on a single; around 1968–69, however, they started to be exclusive mixes with some or all of the vocal mixed out. Producer Bunny Lee notes: \"Yeah...it was really VERSION those days – it wasn't dub yet beca' it was jus' the riddim. One day an incident: Ruddy's (sound system operator Ruddy Redwood) was cutting dub, an when it start, Smithy (recording engineer Byron Smith) look like 'im start bring on the voice and Ruddy's say: no, mek it run and 'im take the whole backing track off it. 'Im say, alright, run it again, and put in the voice. 'Im didn't do no more like that yet.\" After describing how Redwood then had his deejay first play the vocal version and then the instrumental version at a dance, and how popular this novelty was, Lee continued: \"The next day now, 'im start it and just bring in the riddim. Or...down in the tune, bring a little voice and drop it out again...yes. Ruddy use to handle that part himself, drop in the voice and drop it out. All Smithy do was cut the dub...\"[13] Jamaican soundsystems had always sought exclusive recordings from their origins in the late 1940s. However, when they played American rhythm & blues records through the 1950s, these were simply records that rival sound system operators didn't have and couldn't identify. This progressed from the late 1950s onwards via having local musicians record a song exclusively for play on a particular sound system to having exclusive mixes of a song on acetate, which became possible with the arrival of multi-track recording in Jamaica. From the concept of a version with some or all of the vocal mixed out dubbed to acetate, the novelty-hungry sound system scene rapidly drove the evolution of increasingly creative mixes in the first few years of the 1970s. Within a few years the term dub became attached to these regardless of whether they were on an exclusive acetate or \"dubplate\". As the use of the term widened and evolved, Bob Marley and The Wailers used the order \"dub this one!\" in live concerts to mean, \"put an emphasis on bass and drums\". Drummer Sly Dunbar similarly points to a usage of the related term dubwise to mean using only drums and bass.[14] It is possible that the existing use of the word dub for other meanings in Jamaica around the time of the music's origin may have helped to cement its use in the musical context. The most frequent meanings referred to either a form of erotic dance or sexual intercourse;[15] such usage is frequently present in names of reggae songs, for instance, of The Silvertones' \"Dub the Pum Pum\" (where pum pum is Jamaican slang for female genitalia), Big Joe and Fay's \"Dub a Dawta\" (dawta is Jamaican patois for daughter). I-Roy's \"Sister Maggie Breast\" features several references on sex: I man a-dub it on the side Say little sister you can run but you can't hide Slip you got to slide you got to open your crotches wide Peace and love abide However, all three of these songs were recorded"], "reference": "Hopeton \\\"Scientist\\\" Brown was one of the recording engineers and producers who pioneered dub music, along with Osbourne \\\"King Tubby\\\" Ruddock, Lee \\\"Scratch\\\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others.

{"user_input": "According to David Toop, what is the essence of dub music, and how does it transform the structure of musical sequences?", "reference_contexts": ["after the use of dub for a style of remixing was already prevalent. According to David Toop, \"Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation.\"[16] Dub music is characterized by a \"version\" or \"double\"[17] of an existing song, often instrumental, initially almost always pressed on the B-sides of Jamaican 45 rpm records and typically emphasizing the drums and bass for a sound popular in local sound systems. A \"version\" is an alternative cut of a song made for the DJ to \"toast\" over (a form of Jamaican rapping), usually with some or all of the original vocal removed. These \"versions\" were used as the basis of new songs by rerecording them with new elements.[18] The instrumental tracks are typically treated with sound effects such as echo, reverb, with instruments and vocals dropping in and out of the mix. The partial or total removal of vocals and other instruments tends to emphasise the bass guitar. The music sometimes features other noises, such as birds singing, thunder and lightning, water flowing, and producers shouting instructions at the musicians. It can be further augmented by live DJs. The many-layered sounds with varying echoes and volumes are often said to create soundscapes, or sound sculptures, drawing attention to the shape and depth of the space between sounds as well as to the sounds themselves. There is usually a distinctly organic feel to the music, even though the effects are electronically created.[17][19] Often these tracks are used for \"toasters\" rapping heavily rhymed and alliterative lyrics. These are called \"DJ Versions\". In forms of sound system–based reggae, the performer using a microphone is referred to as the \"DJ\" or \"deejay\" (where in other genres, this performer might be termed the \"MC\", meaning \"Master of Ceremonies\", or alternately, the later developed slang terms: \"Microphone Commander\" or \"Mic Control\"), and the person choosing the music and operating the turntables is called the \"selector\" (sometimes referred to as the DJ in other genres). A major reason for producing multiple versions was economic; a record producer could use a recording he owned to produce numerous versions from a single studio session. A version was also an opportunity for a producer or remix engineer to experiment and express their more creative side. The version was typically the B-side of a single, and used for experimenting and providing something for DJs to talk over, while the A-side was more often dedicated to the original vocal-oriented track. In the 1970s, LPs of dub tracks began to be produced; these could be, variously: a collection of new dub mixes of riddims previously used on various singles, usually by a single producer; the dub version of an existing vocal LP with dub mixes of all the tracks; or, least commonly, a selection of previously unissued original riddims mixed in a dub style.[citation needed] Dub music and toasting introduced a new era of creativity in reggae music. From their beginning, toasting and dub music developed together and influenced each other. The development of sound system culture influenced the development of studio techniques in Jamaica,[20] and the earliest DJs, including Duke Reid and Prince Buster among others, were toasting over instrumental versions of reggae and developing instrumental reggae music.[21] In 1968, Kingston, Jamaica sound system operator Rudolph \"Ruddy\" Redwood went to Duke Reid's Treasure Isle studio to cut a one-off dub plate of The Paragons hit \"On The Beach\". Engineer Byron Smith left the vocal track out by accident, but Redwood kept the result and played it at his next dance with his deejay Wassy toasting over the rhythm.[22] The instrumental record excited the people at the sound system and they started singing lyrics of the vocal track over the instrumental. The invention was a success, and Ruddy needed to play the instrumental continuously for half an hour to an hour that day.[23] The next day Bunny Lee who was a witness to this, told King Tubby that they needed to make some more instrumental tracks, as \"them people love\" them, and they dubbed out vocals from \"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\" by Slim Smith. Because of King Tubby's innovative approach, the resulting instrumental track was more than just a track without a voice – King Tubby interchanged the vocals and the instrumental, playing the vocals first, then playing the riddim, then mixing them together. From this point on, they started to call such tracks \"versions\".[23] Another source puts 1967 and not 1968 as the initial year of the practice of putting instrumental versions of reggae tracks to the B-side of records.[24] At Studio One the initial motivation to experiment with instrumental tracks and studio mixing was correcting the riddim until it had a \"feel,\" so a singer, for instance, could comfortably sing over it.[23] Another reason to experiment with mixing was rivalry among sound systems. Sound systems' sound men wanted the tracks they played at dances to be slightly different each time, so they would order numerous copies of the same record from a studio, each with a different mix.[25] By 1973, through the efforts of several independent and competitive innovators, engineers, and producers, instrumental reggae \"versions\" from various studios had evolved into \"dub\" as a subgenre of reggae. The innovative album The Undertaker by Derrick Harriott and the Crystallites, engineered by Errol Thompson and with \"Sound Effects\" credited to Derrick Harriott, was one of the first strictly instrumental reggae albums on its release in 1970. In 1973, at least three producers, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and the Aquarius studio engineer/producer team of Herman Chin Loy and Errol Thompson simultaneously recognized that there was an active market for this new \"dub\" sound and consequently they started to release the first albums strictly consisting of dub. In the spring of 1973, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry released Upsetters 14 Dub Blackboard Jungle, mixed in collaboration with King Tubby and more commonly known as \"Blackboard Jungle Dub\". It is considered a landmark recording of this genre.[26] In"], "reference": "According to David Toop, \"Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation.\"", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "How did The Clash influence dub music?", "reference_contexts": ["1974, Keith Hudson released his classic Pick a Dub, widely considered to have been the first deliberately thematic dub album, with tracks specifically mixed in the dub style for the purpose of appearing together on an LP, and King Tubby released his two debut albums At the Grass Roots of Dub and Surrounded by the Dreads at the National Arena. Dub has continued to evolve, its popularity waxing and waning with changes in musical fashion. Almost all reggae singles still carry an instrumental version on the B-side and these are still used by the sound systems as a blank canvas for live singers and DJs. In 1986, the Japanese band Mute Beat would create dub music using live instruments such as trumpets rather than studio equipment, and became a precursor to club music.[27] In the 1980s, the United Kingdom became a new centre for dub production with Mikey Dread, Mad Professor and Jah Shaka being the most famous. It was also the time when dub made its influence known in the work of harder edged, experimental producers such as Mikey Dread with UB40 and The Clash, Adrian Sherwood and the roster of artists on his On-U Sound label. Many bands characterized as post-punk were heavily influenced by dub. Better-known bands such as The Police, The Clash and UB40 helped popularize Dub, with UB40's Present Arms In Dub album being the first dub album to hit the UK top 40. Side by side with reggae at this time (early 1980s) running B side dub mixes, a rising number of American (mostly New York state and New Jersey–based) post-disco record producers in collaboration with prominent DJs decided to supply 12 inch singles with alternate dub mixes, predating the era of \"remixes\". Reflected in the production of records such as The Peech Boys' \"Don't Make Me Wait\", Toney Lee's \"Reach Up\", and artists mostly on New York City labels Prelude or West End. In the aforementioned mixes the beat of the record was accentuated, \"unnecessary\" vocal parts dropped, and other DJ-friendly features making it easy to work with, like picking out key sections to play over other records, heightening the dancefloor effect. Contemporary instances are also called \"dubtronica\", \"dub-techno\", \"steppers\" or electronic music influenced by dub music.[28] Yale professor Michael Veal described dub as \"the sound of a society tearing itself apart at the seams\". His book, \"Starship Africa\", says that the African diaspora is reflected in dub by the \"extensive use of reverberation/delay devices and the fragmentation of the song surface\" – he considers dub's use of reverb a \"sonic metaphor for the condition of diaspora.\" Veal wrote that dub creators used echo and reverb to elicit memories of African culture in their listeners.[29] King Tubby, Lee Perry, Erroll Thompson, Mad Professor, Jah Shaka, Denis Bovell and Linton Kwesi Johnson influenced rock musicians. From the 1980s forward, dub has been influenced by, and has in turn influenced, techno, dubtronica/dub techno, jungle, drum and bass, dubstep, house music, punk and post-punk, trip hop, ambient music, and hip hop, with electronic dub sound. Musicians and bands such as Culture Club,[30] Bill Laswell, Jah Wobble, New Age Steppers,[31] Public Image Ltd, The Pop Group, The Police, Massive Attack, The Clash, Adrian Sherwood, Killing Joke,[32] Bauhaus and others demonstrate clear dub influences in their respective genres, and their innovations have in turn influenced the mainstream of the dub genre. In 1987, US grunge rock band Soundgarden released a dub version of the Ohio Players' song \"Fopp\" alongside a more traditional rock cover of the song.[33] DJs appeared towards the end of the 1990s who specialised in playing music by these musicians, such as the UK's Unity Dub. In the UK, Europe, and America, independent record producers continue to produce dub. Before forming The Mars Volta, Cedric Bixler, Omar Rodriguez and other members, recorded a series of dub albums under the name De Facto since 1999. Since the inception of dub in the late 1960s, its history has been intertwined with that of the punk rock scene in the UK. The Clash worked on collaborations involving Jamaican dub reggae creators like Lee \"Scratch\" Perry (whose \"Police & Thieves\", co-written with Junior Murvin, was covered by the Clash on their first album) and Mikey Dread (on the Sandinista! album). As well, the English group Ruts DC, a post-Malcolm Owen incarnation of the legendary reggae influenced punk group The Ruts, released Rhythm Collision Dub Volume 1 (Roir session), with the expertise of the Mad Professor. Many punk rock bands In the U.S. were exposed to dub via the rasta punk band Bad Brains from Washington, D.C., which was established and released their most influential material during the 1980s. Blind Idiot God placed dub music alongside their faster and more intense noise rock tracks. Dub was adopted by some punk rock groups of the 90s, with bands such as Rancid and NOFX writing original songs in a dub style.[34] Often, bands considered to be ska punk play dub influenced songs; one of the first such bands to become popular was Sublime, whose albums featured both dub originals and remixes. They went on to influence more recent American bands such as Rx Bandits and The Long Beach Dub Allstars. In addition, dub influenced some types of pop, including bands such as No Doubt. No Doubt's fifth album, Rock Steady, features an assortment of popular dub sounds like reverb and echoing. As noted by the band themselves, No Doubt is heavily influenced by Jamaican musical aesthetics and production techniques, even recording their Rock Steady album in Kingston, Jamaica, and producing B-sides featuring dub influences on their Everything in Time B-sides album. Some controversy still exists on whether pop-ska bands like No Doubt can regard themselves as a part of dub lineage. Other bands followed in the footsteps of No Doubt, fusing pop-ska and dub influences, such as Save Ferris and Vincent. There are also some British punk bands creating dub music.

The post-punk band Public Image Ltd, fronted by John Lydon, formerly of Sex Pistols, often use dub and reggae influenced bass lines in their music, especially in their earlier music through various bassists who were members of the group, such as Jah Wobble and Jonas Hellborg. Their track \"Rise\", which reached No. 11 in the UK Chart in 1986 uses a dub/reggae influenced bass line. The British post-punk band Bauhaus were highly influenced by dub music, so far that Bauhaus' bass player, David J mentioned that their signature song, \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", \"was our interpretation of dub\".[35][36][37] Shoegaze bands such as Ride with their song \"King Bullshit\" and the intro to \"Time Machine\" have explored and experimented with dub. Slowdive also penned \"Souvlaki Space Station\" and their instrumental \"Moussaka Chaos\" as a testimony of dub influence, while the Kitchens of Distinction released \"Anvil Dub\". Steve Hogarth, singer with British rock band Marillion, acknowledged the influence of dub on their 2001 album Anoraknophobia.[38] Al Cisneros, founder and bassist of Doom Metal outfit OM has gone on record regarding the influence of Reggae and Dub on his bass playing style.[39] Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators of dub such as Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Mad Professor have produced music in the 21st century. New artists continue to preserve the traditional dub sound, some with slight modifications but with a primary focus on reproducing the original characteristics of the sound in a live environment. Some of these artists include Dubblestandart from Vienna, Austria (who recorded the album Return from Planet Dub in collaboration with, and performing live with, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry); Liquid Stranger from Sweden; New York City artists, including Ticklah (also known as Victor Axelrod, Earl Maxton, Calbert Walker, and Douglass & Degraw), Victor Rice, Easy Star All-Stars, and Dub Trio—who have recorded and performed live with Mike Patton and are currently touring as the backing band for Matisyahu); Subatomic Sound System (who have remixed material by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Ari Up); Dub Is a Weapon; King Django; Dr. Israel; Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad from Rochester, New York; the Heavyweight Dub Champion from San Francisco and Colorado, Gaudi; Ott from the UK, who has released several influential albums through Twisted Records, Boom One Sound System, and Dubsmith from the Boom One Records label; Future Pigeon from Los Angeles; German artists like Disrupt and Rootah from the Jahtari label; Twilight Circus from the Netherlands; Moonlight Dub Experiment from Costa Rica; and Stand High Patrol from France. More eclectic use of dub techniques are apparent in the work of BudNubac, which mixes Cuban big band with dub techniques. Modern dub producer Ryan Moore has received critical acclaim for his Twilight Circus project. In 2022 was released Sly & Robbie vs. Roots Radics \"The Dub Battle\" produced by the Argentine artist and dub engineer Hernan \"Don Camel\" Sforzini, this work is the first to reunite all the legends of dub in one album dubbing the entire \"The Final Battle\" album, Grammy nominated in 2019. This album includes the last dubs produced by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Bunny \"Striker\" Lee, also dub versions produced by King Jammy, Mad Professor, Dennis Bovell, Don Camel and two unreleased dub versions of King Tubby.[40] Dub music is in conversation with the cultural aesthetic of Afrofuturism. Having emerged from Jamaica, this genre is regarded as the product of diaspora peoples, whose culture reflects the experience of dislocation, alienation and remembrance. Through the creation of space-filling soundscapes, faded echoes, and repetition within musical tracks, Dub artists are able to tap into such Afrofuturist concepts as the nonlinearity of time and the projection of past sounds into an unknown future space. In a 1982 essay,[41] Luke Ehrlich describes Dub through this particular scope: With dub, Jamaican music spaced out completely. If reggae is Africa in the New World, then dub must be Africa on the moon; it's the psychedelic music I expected to hear in the '60s and didn't. The bass and drums conjure up a dark, vast space, a musical portrait of outer space, with sounds suspended like glowing planets or the fragments of instruments careening by, leaving trails like comets and meteors. Dub is a kaleidoscopic musical montage which takes sounds originally intended as interlocking parts of another arrangement and using them as raw material, converts them into new and different sounds; then, in its own rhythm and format, it continually reshuffles these new sounds into unusual juxtapositions. At the same time, dub music's role in the Black musical canon marks a theme of the diaspora the music was birthed from. Due to the sonic structure of echoes and reverberations, dub can create a dream-like world symbolizing the generational trauma of African diaspora as a result of slavery.[42] This understanding of dub gives it the power to take on the darker emotions related to the diaspora, including violence. In King Tubby's dub mixes, one can hear sonic elements of screeching tires, gun fire, and police sirens.[43] Artist Arthur Jafa said this about dub music and the diaspora in 1994 during a keynote address at the Organization of Black Designers Conference:[43] those group experiences that reconfigure who we [African Americans] are as a community. One of the critical primal sites would be the Middle Passage. If you understand the level of horror directed towards a group of people, then you start getting some sense of the magnitude, impact, and level of trauma that that had on the African American community, and how it was particularly one of the earliest group experiences that reshaped an \"African psyche\" into the beginning of an African American psyche. . . . Now, for example, you look at Black music and see certain structural things that really are about reclaiming this whole sense of absence, loss, not knowing.

{"user_input": "How did the genre criticism surrounding hypnagogic pop evolve, and how did this relate to the sense of nostalgia it evoked for 1980s pop culture?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nHypnagogic pop (abbreviated as h-pop) is pop or psychedelic music[5][6] that evokes cultural memory and nostalgia for the popular entertainment of the past (principally the 1980s). It emerged in the mid to late 2000s as American lo-fi and noise musicians began adopting retro aesthetics remembered from their childhood, such as radio rock, new wave pop, synth-pop, video game music, light rock, and R&B. Recordings circulated on cassette or Internet blogs and were typically marked by the use of outmoded analog equipment and DIY experimentation. The genre's name was coined by journalist David Keenan in an August 2009 issue of The Wire to label the developing trend, which he characterized as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory.\"[7] It was used interchangeably with \"chillwave\" or \"glo-fi\" and gained critical attention through artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro.[5] The music has been variously described as a 21st-century update of psychedelia, a reappropriation of media-saturated capitalist culture, and an \"American cousin\" to British hauntology. In response to Keenan's article, The Wire received a slew of hate mail that derided hypnagogic pop as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\".[5] Some of the tagged artists rejected the label or denied that such a unified style exists.[5] During the 2010s, critical attention for the genre waned, although the style's \"revisionist nostalgia\" sublimated into various youth-oriented cultural zeitgeists. Hypnagogic pop evolved into vaporwave, with which it is sometimes conflated. Hypnagogic pop is pop or psychedelic music that draws heavily from the popular music and culture of the 1980s[8][6][9] – also ranging from the 1970s[10] to the early 1990s.[11] The genre reflects a preoccupation with outmoded analog technology and bombastic representations of synthetic elements from these epochs of pop culture, with its creators informed by collective memory as well as their personal histories.[12] Per the imprecise nature of memory, the genre does not faithfully recreate the sounds and styles popular in those periods.[1] In this way, hypnagogic pop distinguishes itself from revivalist movements. As authors Maël Guesdon and Philippe Le Guern write, the genre can be described as \"revisionist nostalgia, not in the sense that 'everything used to be better' but because it rewrites collective memory with a view to being more faithful to an idea or a memory of the original than to the original itself.\"[13] Examples of specific sounds evoked by hypnagogic pop artists range from \"ecstatically blurry and irradiated lo-fi pop\" to \"seventies cosmic-synth-rock\" and \"tripped-out, tribal exotica\".[14] Writing for Vice in 2011, Morgan Poyau described the genre as \"making awkward bedfellows out of experimental music enthusiasts and weird progressive pop theorists.\"[15] He described a typical manifestation of the style as featuring long tracks \"saturated with echo, delay, smothered guitars and amputated synths.\"[15] Critic Adam Trainer writes that, rather than a particular sound, the music was defined by a collection of artists who shared the same approaches and cultural experiences. He observed that their music drew from \"the collective unconscious of late 1980s and early 1990s popular culture\" while being \"indebted stylistically to various traditions of experimentalism such as noise, drone, repetition, and improvisation.\"[16] Common reference points include various forms of 1980s music, including radio rock, new wave pop, MTV one-hit wonders, New Age music, synth-driven Hollywood blockbuster soundtracks,[9] lounge music, easy-listening, corporate muzak, lite rock \"schmaltz\", video game music,[1] and 1980s synth-pop and R&B.[5][17] Recordings are often deliberately degraded, produced with analog equipment, and exhibit recording idiosyncrasies such as tape hiss.[11] It employs sounds that were considered \"futuristic\" during the 1980s which, due to their outmoded nature, appear psychedelic out of context.[11] Also common was the use of outmoded audiovisual technology and DIY digital imagery, such as compact cassettes, VHS, CD-R discs, and early Internet aesthetics.[18] In the 2000s, a wave of retro-inspired home-recording artists began dominating underground indie scenes.[19] The emergence of Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, in particular, prompted journalistic discussion of the philosophical concept of hauntology,[20] most prominently among the writers Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher.[21] Later, the term \"hauntology\" was described as a British synonym for hypnagogic pop,[3] while hypnagogic pop was described as an \"American cousin\" to Britain's hauntological music scene,[22][1][23] Todd Ledford, owner of the music label Olde English Spelling Bee (OESB), attributed a correlation between the proliferation of hypnagogic pop and the rise of YouTube.[24] Reynolds attributed the origins of hypnagogic pop to Southern California and its culture. Trainer disagreed with Reynolds' assertion and said the style \"arguably\" emerged from numerous simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of \"post-noise neo-psychedelia\".[25] Pitchfork's Marc Masters offered that it may have originated \"less [as] a movement than a coincidence\".[26] The music was often issued in the form of limited-edition cassettes or vinyl records before reaching a wider audience through blogs and YouTube videos.[9] Ariel Pink gained recognition in the mid-2000s through a string of self-produced albums, pioneering a sound that Reynolds called \"'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering in and out of the fog\".[27] He identified Pink and the Skaters as the \"godparents of hypnagogic\",[28] but singled out Pink as the central figure to what he calls the \"Altered Zones Generation\", an umbrella term he designed for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, an associate site for Pitchfork.[19][nb 1] Tiny Mix Tapes' Jordan Redmond wrote that Pink's early collaborator John Maus was also placed \"at the nexus of a number of recent popular movements\" including hypnagogic pop, and that Maus was as \"much of a progenitor of this sound as Pink, even though Pink has tended to be the headline-grabber.\"[30] R. Stevie Moore and Martin Newell were earlier artists who anticipated Pink's sound.[19] Matthew Ingram of The Wire recognized Moore's influence on Pink and hypnagogic pop: \"through his disciple ... he has unwittingly provided the [genre's] template\".[31][nb 2] Another precursor to the genre was Nick Nicely and his 1982 single \"Hilly Fields (1892)\". Red Bull Music's J.R. Moore wrote that Nicely's \"uniquely haphazard DIY aesthetic\"", "<2-hop>\n\nand contemporary take on 1960s psychedelic pop \"basically invented the sound of the 2000s Hypnagogic Pop movement decades beforehand.\"[33][nb 3] The Skaters were a noise duo consisting of James Ferraro and Spencer Clark, and like Pink, were based in California.[34] In the mid-2000s, they released dozens of CD-Rs and cassettes of psychedelic drone music, after which Ferraro and Clark each pursued solo outings.[11] From 2009 to 2010, Ferraro's music evolved to be increasingly rhythmic and melodic, as Trainer describes, \"an oversaturated sonic palette of cheesy pop reminiscent of early video game soundtracks and 1980s Saturday morning cartoons.\"[35] Complex contributor Joe Price felt that the h-pop movement was \"birthed\" by Ferraro and \"the vastly overlooked [Missouri artist] 18 Carat Affair\".[36] In Reynolds' description, \"other rising figures\" from the original California scene included Sun Araw, LA Vampires and Puro Instinct. He added: \"Other key hypnagogues such as Matrix Metals and Rangers reside elsewhere but seem SoCal in spirit.\"[9] In a 2009 interview, Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) stated that Salvador Dalí and Danny Wolfers were the \"godfathers of hpop\". He identified other progenitors to be DJ Screw, \"retro kids\", Joe Wenderoth, Autre Ne Veut, Church In Moon and DJ Dog Dick.[37] Journalist David Keenan, who was known as a reporter of noise, freak folk, and drone music scenes, coined \"hypnagogic pop\" in an August 2009 piece for The Wire.[14] Keenan applied the label to a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists engaged with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outdated recording technology.

Ouspensky, Keenan employed the term \"hypnagogic\" as referring to the psychological state \"between waking and sleeping, liminal zones where mis-hearings and hallucinations feed into the formation of dreams.\"[11] The term reportedly originated with a comment by James Ferraro about the notion that 1980s sounds had seeped into the unconscious of contemporary musicians while they were toddlers falling asleep and their parents played music in another room.[38][page needed] Among the artists discussed in Keenan's article were Ariel Pink, Daniel Lopatin, the Skaters, the Savage Young Taterbug, Gary War, Zola Jesus, Ducktails, Emeralds, and Pocahaunted.[11][nb 4] According to Keenan, these artists drew on cultural sources subconsciously remembered from their 1980s and early 1990s adolescence while freeing them from their historical contexts and \"hom[ing] in on the futuristic signifiers\" of the period.[11] He alternately summarized hypnagogic pop as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory\" and as \"1980's-inspired psychedelia\" that engages with capitalist detritus of the past in an attempt to \"dream of the future.\"[11] In a later article, Keenan identified Lopatin, Ferraro, Clark, and ex-Test Icicles member Sam Mehran as hypnagogic pop's \"most adventurous proponents\".[39] Once \"hypnagogic pop\" was coined, a variety of music blogs wrote about the phenomenon.[15] By 2010, albums by Ariel Pink and Neon Indian were regularly hailed by publications like Pitchfork and The Wire, with \"hypnagogic pop\", \"chillwave\", and \"glo-fi\" employed to describe the evolving sounds of such artists, a number of which had songs of considerable success within independent music circles.[5] Pink was frequently called \"godfather\" of h-pop, chillwave or glo-fi as new acts that were associated with him (aesthetically, personally, geographically, or professionally) attracted notice from critics.[41] Some of his contemporaries, such as Ferraro, Clark, and War, failed to match his mainstream success. When this point was raised to Clark in a 2013 interview, he replied that Pink was simply \"an ambassador of California, like the Beach Boys.\"[42] In 2010, Pitchfork launched Altered Zones, effectively an online newsletter for hypnagogic acts.[39] Beginning that July, Altered Zones aggregated its content from a collective of leading blogs specializing in the movement.[14] By the end of the year, OESB, now known for its roster of hypnagogic acts such as Ferraro and Mehran, had grown to be one of the most prominent underground indie labels.[24] In January 2011, Keenan wrote that OESB was \"the imprint most associated with H-pop\" and \"in many ways ... the label of 2010\", although he mused, \"[I]ts demographic has morphed from an early underground/Noise audience to being embraced by the fringes of indie and dance culture, helped by groups like Forest Swords, who muddy the line between H-pop and dubstep.\"[39] \"Chillwave\", a tag used to describe a similar trend,[43] was coined one month before Keenan's 2009 article[44] and was adopted synonymously with \"hypnagogic pop\".[45] While the two styles are similar in that they both evoke 1980s–90s imagery, chillwave has a more commercial sound with an emphasis on \"cheesy\" hooks and reverb effects.[46] A contemporary review by Marc Hogan for Neon Indian's Psychic Chasms (2009) listed \"dream-beat\", \"chillwave\", \"glo-fi\", \"hypnagogic pop\", and \"hipster-gogic pop\" as interchangeable terms for \"psychedelic music that's generally one or all of the following: synth-based, homemade-sounding, 80s-referencing, cassette-oriented, sun-baked, laid-back, warped, hazy, emotionally distant, slightly out of focus.\"[47] The experimental tendencies of hypnagogic pop artists like Pink and Ferraro were soon amplified by the Internet-centric genre dubbed \"vaporwave\". Although the name shares the \"-wave\" suffix, it is only loosely connected to chillwave.[4] Sam Mehran was one of the earliest hypnagogic acts to anticipate vaporwave, with his project Matrix Metals and the 2009 album Flamingo Breeze, which was built on synthesizer loops.[48] That same year, Lopatin uploaded a collection of plunderphonics loops to YouTube inconspicuously under the alias sunsetcorp. These clips were later assembled for the album Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 (2010).[36] Stereogum's Miles Bowe summarized vaporwave as a combination of \"the chopped and screwed plunderphonics of Dan Lopatin ... with the nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraro’s Muzak-hellscapes on [the 2011 album] Far Side Virtual\".[4][nb 5] Writers, fans, and artists struggled to differentiate between hypnagogic pop, chillwave, and vaporwave.[50] The term \"vaporwave\" is generally attributed to an October 2011 blog post that discussed the hypnagogic album Surfs Pure Hearts by Girlhood.[50] Adam Harper surmised that the author cited the work as \"vaporwave\" instead of \"hypnagogic pop\" possibly because they were unfamiliar with the latter", "<3-hop>\n\nterm. He jokingly remarked of \"a special place in hell\" for those who attempt to separate the three genres: \"it's a back room where Satan forever explains the differences between death metal, black metal and doom metal.\"[50] According to Harper, vaporwave and hypnagogic pop share an affinity for \"trash music\", both are \"dreamy\" and \"chirpy\", and both \"manipulate their material to defamiliarise it and give it a sense of the uncanny, such as slowing it down and/or lowering the pitch, making it, as the term goes, ‘screwed’.\"[10] Of differences, vaporwave does not typically engage in long tracks, lo-fi productions, or non-sampled material, and it draws more from the early 1990s than it does the 1970s and 1980s.[10] Vaporwave has a stronger musical connection to chillwave than to hypnagogic pop for its sampling of slowed-down synth funk.[50] David Keenan's original Wire article incited a slew of hate mail that derided the \"hypnagogic pop\" label as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\".[5] As the movement's popularity grew, the analogue lo-fi aspirations of Pink and Ferraro were taken up by \"groups with names like Tape Deck Mountain, Memory Tapes, Memory Cassette – and turned into cliché.\"[51] Both chillwave and vaporwave had been conceived as tongue-in-cheek, hyperbolic responses to such trends.[10][52] Keenan became disenchanted with artists of the movement who streamlined their sound[53] and \"chillwave\" came to serve as a pejorative for such acts.[54] In the 2010 Rewind issue of The Wire, Keenan said that h-pop had \"migrated from a process designed to liberate desire from marketing formulas to a carrot in the mouth of a corpse that has proved irresistible to underground musicians looking for an easy route to mainstream acceptance.\"[39][nb 6] He invoked chillwave as \"one of the more meaningless sobriquets applied to the new future pop visions\" and \"a much more appropriate description of the mindless, depoliticised embracing of mainstream values that H-pop has come to be associated with.\"[39] Some of the tagged artists, such as Neon Indian and Toro y Moi, rejected the h-pop tag or denied that such a unified style exists.[5][nb 7] The Guardian's Dorian Lynskey called the hypnagogic tag \"pretentious\",[58] while New York Times writer Jon Pareles criticized the style as \"annoyingly noncommittal music\". The latter described a showcase of such bands at the 2010 South by Southwest festival as \"a hedged, hipster imitation of the pop they're not brash enough to make\".[5] Altered Zones contributor Emilie Friedlander prophesied in 2011 that Ariel Pink, John Maus, James Ferraro, Charles Free, Spencer Clark, and R. Stevie Moore would be remembered as musicians who \"elevated the crackle and grain of low-fidelity recording ... and made the vocabulary of pop music and the preoccupations of the avant-garde seem a lot less incompatible than much of the previous century had implied.\"[59] However, like Keenan, she later wrote of her disenchantment with the movement following the \"deliberately cringeworthy\" example of Ferraro's Far Side Virtual.[53][nb 8] Weeks after the album's release, Altered Zones shut down.[53][nb 9] OESB also went defunct the same year.[61] Usage of \"hypnagogic pop\" has since diminished,[62] although the genre's \"imagined sonic past\" has sublimated into various pop culture zeitgeists.[63] Likewise, an affinity for the retro proved itself as a hallmark of 2010s youth culture.[53] In a 2012 interview, Pink acknowledged that he was aware that he \"was doing something that sounded like the trace of a memory you can't place\" and argued that such evocations had become so ingrained into modern music that \"people take it for granted\".[64] On websites such as Drowned in Sound, Dummy Mag, and Electronic Beats, hauntology and hypnagogic pop were ultimately supplanted by an interest in post-Internet artists.[61] Simon Reynolds described hypnagogic pop as a \"21st-century update of psychedelia\" in which \"lost innocence has been contaminated by pop culture\" and hyper-reality.[9] He notes a particular concern with the \"scrambling of pop time\", suggesting that \"perhaps the secret idea buried inside hypnagogic pop is that the '80s never ended. That we're still living there, subject to that decade's endless end of History.\"[9] Guesdon and Le Guern posit that \"the hypnagogic movement can be seen as an aesthetic response to the growing feeling that time is speeding up: a feeling that often proves to be one of the fundamental components of advanced modernity.\"[13] Adam Trainer suggested that the style allowed artists to engage with the products of media-saturated capitalist consumer culture in a way that focuses on affect rather than irony or cynicism.[18] Adam Harper noted among hypnagogic pop artists a tendency \"to turn trash, something shallow and determinedly throwaway, into something sacred or mystical\" and to \"manipulate their material to defamiliarise it and give it a sense of the uncanny.\"[10]"], "reference": "Initially, hypnagogic pop, which evokes cultural memory and nostalgia for 1980s popular entertainment, was met with genre criticism, including hate mail calling it the \"worst genre created by a journalist\".

Later, chillwave came to serve as a pejorative for artists who streamlined their sound, and Keenan expressed disenchantment with the movement.

{"user_input": "Considering the genre criticism surrounding hypnagogic pop and its evocation of nostalgia, how did critics and artists respond to the genre's perceived clichés and its relationship to mainstream acceptance, and how did this impact its evolution and eventual decline?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nHypnagogic pop (abbreviated as h-pop) is pop or psychedelic music[5][6] that evokes cultural memory and nostalgia for the popular entertainment of the past (principally the 1980s). It emerged in the mid to late 2000s as American lo-fi and noise musicians began adopting retro aesthetics remembered from their childhood, such as radio rock, new wave pop, synth-pop, video game music, light rock, and R&B. Recordings circulated on cassette or Internet blogs and were typically marked by the use of outmoded analog equipment and DIY experimentation. The genre's name was coined by journalist David Keenan in an August 2009 issue of The Wire to label the developing trend, which he characterized as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory.\"[7] It was used interchangeably with \"chillwave\" or \"glo-fi\" and gained critical attention through artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro.[5] The music has been variously described as a 21st-century update of psychedelia, a reappropriation of media-saturated capitalist culture, and an \"American cousin\" to British hauntology. In response to Keenan's article, The Wire received a slew of hate mail that derided hypnagogic pop as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\".[5] Some of the tagged artists rejected the label or denied that such a unified style exists.[5] During the 2010s, critical attention for the genre waned, although the style's \"revisionist nostalgia\" sublimated into various youth-oriented cultural zeitgeists. Hypnagogic pop evolved into vaporwave, with which it is sometimes conflated. Hypnagogic pop is pop or psychedelic music that draws heavily from the popular music and culture of the 1980s[8][6][9] – also ranging from the 1970s[10] to the early 1990s.[11] The genre reflects a preoccupation with outmoded analog technology and bombastic representations of synthetic elements from these epochs of pop culture, with its creators informed by collective memory as well as their personal histories.[12] Per the imprecise nature of memory, the genre does not faithfully recreate the sounds and styles popular in those periods.[1] In this way, hypnagogic pop distinguishes itself from revivalist movements. As authors Maël Guesdon and Philippe Le Guern write, the genre can be described as \"revisionist nostalgia, not in the sense that 'everything used to be better' but because it rewrites collective memory with a view to being more faithful to an idea or a memory of the original than to the original itself.\"[13] Examples of specific sounds evoked by hypnagogic pop artists range from \"ecstatically blurry and irradiated lo-fi pop\" to \"seventies cosmic-synth-rock\" and \"tripped-out, tribal exotica\".[14] Writing for Vice in 2011, Morgan Poyau described the genre as \"making awkward bedfellows out of experimental music enthusiasts and weird progressive pop theorists.\"[15] He described a typical manifestation of the style as featuring long tracks \"saturated with echo, delay, smothered guitars and amputated synths.\"[15] Critic Adam Trainer writes that, rather than a particular sound, the music was defined by a collection of artists who shared the same approaches and cultural experiences. He observed that their music drew from \"the collective unconscious of late 1980s and early 1990s popular culture\" while being \"indebted stylistically to various traditions of experimentalism such as noise, drone, repetition, and improvisation.\"[16] Common reference points include various forms of 1980s music, including radio rock, new wave pop, MTV one-hit wonders, New Age music, synth-driven Hollywood blockbuster soundtracks,[9] lounge music, easy-listening, corporate muzak, lite rock \"schmaltz\", video game music,[1] and 1980s synth-pop and R&B.[5][17] Recordings are often deliberately degraded, produced with analog equipment, and exhibit recording idiosyncrasies such as tape hiss.[11] It employs sounds that were considered \"futuristic\" during the 1980s which, due to their outmoded nature, appear psychedelic out of context.[11] Also common was the use of outmoded audiovisual technology and DIY digital imagery, such as compact cassettes, VHS, CD-R discs, and early Internet aesthetics.[18] In the 2000s, a wave of retro-inspired home-recording artists began dominating underground indie scenes.[19] The emergence of Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, in particular, prompted journalistic discussion of the philosophical concept of hauntology,[20] most prominently among the writers Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher.[21] Later, the term \"hauntology\" was described as a British synonym for hypnagogic pop,[3] while hypnagogic pop was described as an \"American cousin\" to Britain's hauntological music scene,[22][1][23] Todd Ledford, owner of the music label Olde English Spelling Bee (OESB), attributed a correlation between the proliferation of hypnagogic pop and the rise of YouTube.[24] Reynolds attributed the origins of hypnagogic pop to Southern California and its culture. Trainer disagreed with Reynolds' assertion and said the style \"arguably\" emerged from numerous simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of \"post-noise neo-psychedelia\".[25] Pitchfork's Marc Masters offered that it may have originated \"less [as] a movement than a coincidence\".[26] The music was often issued in the form of limited-edition cassettes or vinyl records before reaching a wider audience through blogs and YouTube videos.[9] Ariel Pink gained recognition in the mid-2000s through a string of self-produced albums, pioneering a sound that Reynolds called \"'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering in and out of the fog\".[27] He identified Pink and the Skaters as the \"godparents of hypnagogic\",[28] but singled out Pink as the central figure to what he calls the \"Altered Zones Generation\", an umbrella term he designed for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, an associate site for Pitchfork.[19][nb 1] Tiny Mix Tapes' Jordan Redmond wrote that Pink's early collaborator John Maus was also placed \"at the nexus of a number of recent popular movements\" including hypnagogic pop, and that Maus was as \"much of a progenitor of this sound as Pink, even though Pink has tended to be the headline-grabber.\"[30] R. Stevie Moore and Martin Newell were earlier artists who anticipated Pink's sound.[19] Matthew Ingram of The Wire recognized Moore's influence on Pink and hypnagogic pop: \"through his disciple ... he has unwittingly provided the [genre's] template\".[31][nb 2] Another precursor to the genre was Nick Nicely and his 1982 single \"Hilly Fields (1892)\". Red Bull Music's J.R. Moore wrote that Nicely's \"uniquely haphazard DIY aesthetic\"", "<2-hop>\n\nand contemporary take on 1960s psychedelic pop \"basically invented the sound of the 2000s Hypnagogic Pop movement decades beforehand.\"[33][nb 3] The Skaters were a noise duo consisting of James Ferraro and Spencer Clark, and like Pink, were based in California.[34] In the mid-2000s, they released dozens of CD-Rs and cassettes of psychedelic drone music, after which Ferraro and Clark each pursued solo outings.[11] From 2009 to 2010, Ferraro's music evolved to be increasingly rhythmic and melodic, as Trainer describes, \"an oversaturated sonic palette of cheesy pop reminiscent of early video game soundtracks and 1980s Saturday morning cartoons.\"[35] Complex contributor Joe Price felt that the h-pop movement was \"birthed\" by Ferraro and \"the vastly overlooked [Missouri artist] 18 Carat Affair\".[36] In Reynolds' description, \"other rising figures\" from the original California scene included Sun Araw, LA Vampires and Puro Instinct. He added: \"Other key hypnagogues such as Matrix Metals and Rangers reside elsewhere but seem SoCal in spirit.\"[9] In a 2009 interview, Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) stated that Salvador Dalí and Danny Wolfers were the \"godfathers of hpop\". He identified other progenitors to be DJ Screw, \"retro kids\", Joe Wenderoth, Autre Ne Veut, Church In Moon and DJ Dog Dick.[37] Journalist David Keenan, who was known as a reporter of noise, freak folk, and drone music scenes, coined \"hypnagogic pop\" in an August 2009 piece for The Wire.[14] Keenan applied the label to a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists engaged with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outdated recording technology. Inspired by comments by James Ferraro and Spencer Clark, and while invoking a similar concept discussed by Russian esotericist P.D. Ouspensky, Keenan employed the term \"hypnagogic\" as referring to the psychological state \"between waking and sleeping, liminal zones where mis-hearings and hallucinations feed into the formation of dreams.\"[11] The term reportedly originated with a comment by James Ferraro about the notion that 1980s sounds had seeped into the unconscious of contemporary musicians while they were toddlers falling asleep and their parents played music in another room.[38][page needed] Among the artists discussed in Keenan's article were Ariel Pink, Daniel Lopatin, the Skaters, the Savage Young Taterbug, Gary War, Zola Jesus, Ducktails, Emeralds, and Pocahaunted.[11][nb 4] According to Keenan, these artists drew on cultural sources subconsciously remembered from their 1980s and early 1990s adolescence while freeing them from their historical contexts and \"hom[ing] in on the futuristic signifiers\" of the period.[11] He alternately summarized hypnagogic pop as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory\" and as \"1980's-inspired psychedelia\" that engages with capitalist detritus of the past in an attempt to \"dream of the future.\"[11] In a later article, Keenan identified Lopatin, Ferraro, Clark, and ex-Test Icicles member Sam Mehran as hypnagogic pop's \"most adventurous proponents\".[39] Once \"hypnagogic pop\" was coined, a variety of music blogs wrote about the phenomenon.[15] By 2010, albums by Ariel Pink and Neon Indian were regularly hailed by publications like Pitchfork and The Wire, with \"hypnagogic pop\", \"chillwave\", and \"glo-fi\" employed to describe the evolving sounds of such artists, a number of which had songs of considerable success within independent music circles.[5] Pink was frequently called \"godfather\" of h-pop, chillwave or glo-fi as new acts that were associated with him (aesthetically, personally, geographically, or professionally) attracted notice from critics.[41] Some of his contemporaries, such as Ferraro, Clark, and War, failed to match his mainstream success. When this point was raised to Clark in a 2013 interview, he replied that Pink was simply \"an ambassador of California, like the Beach Boys.\"[42] In 2010, Pitchfork launched Altered Zones, effectively an online newsletter for hypnagogic acts.[39] Beginning that July, Altered Zones aggregated its content from a collective of leading blogs specializing in the movement.[14] By the end of the year, OESB, now known for its roster of hypnagogic acts such as Ferraro and Mehran, had grown to be one of the most prominent underground indie labels.[24] In January 2011, Keenan wrote that OESB was \"the imprint most associated with H-pop\" and \"in many ways ... the label of 2010\", although he mused, \"[I]ts demographic has morphed from an early underground/Noise audience to being embraced by the fringes of indie and dance culture, helped by groups like Forest Swords, who muddy the line between H-pop and dubstep.\"[39] \"Chillwave\", a tag used to describe a similar trend,[43] was coined one month before Keenan's 2009 article[44] and was adopted synonymously with \"hypnagogic pop\".[45] While the two styles are similar in that they both evoke 1980s–90s imagery, chillwave has a more commercial sound with an emphasis on \"cheesy\" hooks and reverb effects.[46] A contemporary review by Marc Hogan for Neon Indian's Psychic Chasms (2009) listed \"dream-beat\", \"chillwave\", \"glo-fi\", \"hypnagogic pop\", and \"hipster-gogic pop\" as interchangeable terms for \"psychedelic music that's generally one or all of the following: synth-based, homemade-sounding, 80s-referencing, cassette-oriented, sun-baked, laid-back, warped, hazy, emotionally distant, slightly out of focus.\"[47] The experimental tendencies of hypnagogic pop artists like Pink and Ferraro were soon amplified by the Internet-centric genre dubbed \"vaporwave\". Although the name shares the \"-wave\" suffix, it is only loosely connected to chillwave.[4] Sam Mehran was one of the earliest hypnagogic acts to anticipate vaporwave, with his project Matrix Metals and the 2009 album Flamingo Breeze, which was built on synthesizer loops.[48] That same year, Lopatin uploaded a collection of plunderphonics loops to YouTube inconspicuously under the alias sunsetcorp. These clips were later assembled for the album Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 (2010).[36] Stereogum's Miles Bowe summarized vaporwave as a combination of \"the chopped and screwed plunderphonics of Dan Lopatin ... with the nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraro’s Muzak-hellscapes on [the 2011 album] Far Side Virtual\".[4][nb 5] Writers, fans, and artists struggled to differentiate between hypnagogic pop, chillwave, and vaporwave.[50] The term \"vaporwave\" is generally attributed to an October 2011 blog post that discussed the hypnagogic album Surfs Pure Hearts by Girlhood.[50] Adam Harper surmised that the author cited the work as \"vaporwave\" instead of \"hypnagogic pop\" possibly because they were unfamiliar with the latter", "<3-hop>\n\nterm. He jokingly remarked of \"a special place in hell\" for those who attempt to separate the three genres: \"it's a back room where Satan forever explains the differences between death metal, black metal and doom metal.\"[50] According to Harper, vaporwave and hypnagogic pop share an affinity for \"trash music\", both are \"dreamy\" and \"chirpy\", and both \"manipulate their material to defamiliarise it and give it a sense of the uncanny, such as slowing it down and/or lowering the pitch, making it, as the term goes, ‘screwed’.\"[10] Of differences, vaporwave does not typically engage in long tracks, lo-fi productions, or non-sampled material, and it draws more from the early 1990s than it does the 1970s and 1980s.[10] Vaporwave has a stronger musical connection to chillwave than to hypnagogic pop for its sampling of slowed-down synth funk.[50] David Keenan's original Wire article incited a slew of hate mail that derided the \"hypnagogic pop\" label as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\".[5] As the movement's popularity grew, the analogue lo-fi aspirations of Pink and Ferraro were taken up by \"groups with names like Tape Deck Mountain, Memory Tapes, Memory Cassette – and turned into cliché.\"[51] Both chillwave and vaporwave had been conceived as tongue-in-cheek, hyperbolic responses to such trends.[10][52] Keenan became disenchanted with artists of the movement who streamlined their sound[53] and \"chillwave\" came to serve as a pejorative for such acts.[54] In the 2010 Rewind issue of The Wire, Keenan said that h-pop had \"migrated from a process designed to liberate desire from marketing formulas to a carrot in the mouth of a corpse that has proved irresistible to underground musicians looking for an easy route to mainstream acceptance.\"[39][nb 6] He invoked chillwave as \"one of the more meaningless sobriquets applied to the new future pop visions\" and \"a much more appropriate description of the mindless, depoliticised embracing of mainstream values that H-pop has come to be associated with.\"[39] Some of the tagged artists, such as Neon Indian and Toro y Moi, rejected the h-pop tag or denied that such a unified style exists.[5][nb 7] The Guardian's Dorian Lynskey called the hypnagogic tag \"pretentious\",[58] while New York Times writer Jon Pareles criticized the style as \"annoyingly noncommittal music\".

{"user_input": "How dub music, a subgenre of reggae, relate to Afrofuturism and how it use sound to reflect diaspora experience?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nDub is a musical style that grew out of reggae in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style.[1] Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings[2] created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, emphasis of the rhythm section (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a riddim), the application of studio effects such as echo and reverb, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.[3] Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock, Hopeton \"Scientist\" Brown, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others[1] beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy.[4] These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.[5] Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk,[6] pop,[7] hip hop,[6] post-disco, and later house,[8] techno,[8] ambient,[8] electronic dance music,[9] and trip hop.[8] Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass, as well as a major influence on dubstep, with its orientation around bass and utilization of audio effects.[10][11][12] Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material. The use of the word dub in a recording context originated in the late 1920s with the advent of \"talking pictures\" and referred to adding a soundtrack to a film; it is an informal abbreviation of the word double. Over the next 40 years or so the term found its way into audio recording in general, often in the context of making a copy of a recording on another tape or disc. It was in this sense that the term was first used in the Jamaican recording industry: new recordings were often initially copied onto one-off acetate discs, known colloquially as soft wax[13] or dub and later as dubplates, for exclusive use by sound system operators; playing a song as an exclusive recording on a sound system was a good way for a producer to test the potential popularity of a recording before committing to the pressing of hundreds or thousands of copies of singles for retail sale. Initially, these acetates would simply be the standard recording of a song that was yet to be released on a single; around 1968–69, however, they started to be exclusive mixes with some or all of the vocal mixed out. Producer Bunny Lee notes: \"Yeah...it was really VERSION those days – it wasn't dub yet beca' it was jus' the riddim. One day an incident: Ruddy's (sound system operator Ruddy Redwood) was cutting dub, an when it start, Smithy (recording engineer Byron Smith) look like 'im start bring on the voice and Ruddy's say: no, mek it run and 'im take the whole backing track off it. 'Im say, alright, run it again, and put in the voice. 'Im didn't do no more like that yet.\" After describing how Redwood then had his deejay first play the vocal version and then the instrumental version at a dance, and how popular this novelty was, Lee continued: \"The next day now, 'im start it and just bring in the riddim. Or...down in the tune, bring a little voice and drop it out again...yes. Ruddy use to handle that part himself, drop in the voice and drop it out. All Smithy do was cut the dub...\"[13] Jamaican soundsystems had always sought exclusive recordings from their origins in the late 1940s. However, when they played American rhythm & blues records through the 1950s, these were simply records that rival sound system operators didn't have and couldn't identify. This progressed from the late 1950s onwards via having local musicians record a song exclusively for play on a particular sound system to having exclusive mixes of a song on acetate, which became possible with the arrival of multi-track recording in Jamaica. From the concept of a version with some or all of the vocal mixed out dubbed to acetate, the novelty-hungry sound system scene rapidly drove the evolution of increasingly creative mixes in the first few years of the 1970s. Within a few years the term dub became attached to these regardless of whether they were on an exclusive acetate or \"dubplate\". As the use of the term widened and evolved, Bob Marley and The Wailers used the order \"dub this one!\" in live concerts to mean, \"put an emphasis on bass and drums\". Drummer Sly Dunbar similarly points to a usage of the related term dubwise to mean using only drums and bass.[14] It is possible that the existing use of the word dub for other meanings in Jamaica around the time of the music's origin may have helped to cement its use in the musical context. The most frequent meanings referred to either a form of erotic dance or sexual intercourse;[15] such usage is frequently present in names of reggae songs, for instance, of The Silvertones' \"Dub the Pum Pum\" (where pum pum is Jamaican slang for female genitalia), Big Joe and Fay's \"Dub a Dawta\" (dawta is Jamaican patois for daughter). I-Roy's \"Sister Maggie Breast\" features several references on sex: I man a-dub it on the side Say little sister you can run but you can't hide Slip you got to slide you got to open your crotches wide Peace and love abide However, all three of these songs were recorded", "<2-hop>\n\nafter the use of dub for a style of remixing was already prevalent. According to David Toop, \"Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation.\"[16] Dub music is characterized by a \"version\" or \"double\"[17] of an existing song, often instrumental, initially almost always pressed on the B-sides of Jamaican 45 rpm records and typically emphasizing the drums and bass for a sound popular in local sound systems. A \"version\" is an alternative cut of a song made for the DJ to \"toast\" over (a form of Jamaican rapping), usually with some or all of the original vocal removed. These \"versions\" were used as the basis of new songs by rerecording them with new elements.[18] The instrumental tracks are typically treated with sound effects such as echo, reverb, with instruments and vocals dropping in and out of the mix. The partial or total removal of vocals and other instruments tends to emphasise the bass guitar. The music sometimes features other noises, such as birds singing, thunder and lightning, water flowing, and producers shouting instructions at the musicians. It can be further augmented by live DJs. The many-layered sounds with varying echoes and volumes are often said to create soundscapes, or sound sculptures, drawing attention to the shape and depth of the space between sounds as well as to the sounds themselves. There is usually a distinctly organic feel to the music, even though the effects are electronically created.[17][19] Often these tracks are used for \"toasters\" rapping heavily rhymed and alliterative lyrics. These are called \"DJ Versions\". In forms of sound system–based reggae, the performer using a microphone is referred to as the \"DJ\" or \"deejay\" (where in other genres, this performer might be termed the \"MC\", meaning \"Master of Ceremonies\", or alternately, the later developed slang terms: \"Microphone Commander\" or \"Mic Control\"), and the person choosing the music and operating the turntables is called the \"selector\" (sometimes referred to as the DJ in other genres). A major reason for producing multiple versions was economic; a record producer could use a recording he owned to produce numerous versions from a single studio session. A version was also an opportunity for a producer or remix engineer to experiment and express their more creative side. The version was typically the B-side of a single, and used for experimenting and providing something for DJs to talk over, while the A-side was more often dedicated to the original vocal-oriented track. In the 1970s, LPs of dub tracks began to be produced; these could be, variously: a collection of new dub mixes of riddims previously used on various singles, usually by a single producer; the dub version of an existing vocal LP with dub mixes of all the tracks; or, least commonly, a selection of previously unissued original riddims mixed in a dub style.[citation needed] Dub music and toasting introduced a new era of creativity in reggae music. From their beginning, toasting and dub music developed together and influenced each other. The development of sound system culture influenced the development of studio techniques in Jamaica,[20] and the earliest DJs, including Duke Reid and Prince Buster among others, were toasting over instrumental versions of reggae and developing instrumental reggae music.[21] In 1968, Kingston, Jamaica sound system operator Rudolph \"Ruddy\" Redwood went to Duke Reid's Treasure Isle studio to cut a one-off dub plate of The Paragons hit \"On The Beach\". Engineer Byron Smith left the vocal track out by accident, but Redwood kept the result and played it at his next dance with his deejay Wassy toasting over the rhythm.[22] The instrumental record excited the people at the sound system and they started singing lyrics of the vocal track over the instrumental. The invention was a success, and Ruddy needed to play the instrumental continuously for half an hour to an hour that day.[23] The next day Bunny Lee who was a witness to this, told King Tubby that they needed to make some more instrumental tracks, as \"them people love\" them, and they dubbed out vocals from \"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\" by Slim Smith. Because of King Tubby's innovative approach, the resulting instrumental track was more than just a track without a voice – King Tubby interchanged the vocals and the instrumental, playing the vocals first, then playing the riddim, then mixing them together. From this point on, they started to call such tracks \"versions\".[23] Another source puts 1967 and not 1968 as the initial year of the practice of putting instrumental versions of reggae tracks to the B-side of records.[24] At Studio One the initial motivation to experiment with instrumental tracks and studio mixing was correcting the riddim until it had a \"feel,\" so a singer, for instance, could comfortably sing over it.[23] Another reason to experiment with mixing was rivalry among sound systems. Sound systems' sound men wanted the tracks they played at dances to be slightly different each time, so they would order numerous copies of the same record from a studio, each with a different mix.[25] By 1973, through the efforts of several independent and competitive innovators, engineers, and producers, instrumental reggae \"versions\" from various studios had evolved into \"dub\" as a subgenre of reggae. The innovative album The Undertaker by Derrick Harriott and the Crystallites, engineered by Errol Thompson and with \"Sound Effects\" credited to Derrick Harriott, was one of the first strictly instrumental reggae albums on its release in 1970. In 1973, at least three producers, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and the Aquarius studio engineer/producer team of Herman Chin Loy and Errol Thompson simultaneously recognized that there was an active market for this new \"dub\" sound and consequently they started to release the first albums strictly consisting of dub. In the spring of 1973, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry released Upsetters 14 Dub Blackboard Jungle, mixed in collaboration with King Tubby and more commonly known as \"Blackboard Jungle Dub\". It is considered a landmark recording of this genre.[26] In", "<3-hop>\n\n1974, Keith Hudson released his classic Pick a Dub, widely considered to have been the first deliberately thematic dub album, with tracks specifically mixed in the dub style for the purpose of appearing together on an LP, and King Tubby released his two debut albums At the Grass Roots of Dub and Surrounded by the Dreads at the National Arena. Dub has continued to evolve, its popularity waxing and waning with changes in musical fashion. Almost all reggae singles still carry an instrumental version on the B-side and these are still used by the sound systems as a blank canvas for live singers and DJs. In 1986, the Japanese band Mute Beat would create dub music using live instruments such as trumpets rather than studio equipment, and became a precursor to club music.[27] In the 1980s, the United Kingdom became a new centre for dub production with Mikey Dread, Mad Professor and Jah Shaka being the most famous. It was also the time when dub made its influence known in the work of harder edged, experimental producers such as Mikey Dread with UB40 and The Clash, Adrian Sherwood and the roster of artists on his On-U Sound label. Many bands characterized as post-punk were heavily influenced by dub. Better-known bands such as The Police, The Clash and UB40 helped popularize Dub, with UB40's Present Arms In Dub album being the first dub album to hit the UK top 40. Side by side with reggae at this time (early 1980s) running B side dub mixes, a rising number of American (mostly New York state and New Jersey–based) post-disco record producers in collaboration with prominent DJs decided to supply 12 inch singles with alternate dub mixes, predating the era of \"remixes\". Reflected in the production of records such as The Peech Boys' \"Don't Make Me Wait\", Toney Lee's \"Reach Up\", and artists mostly on New York City labels Prelude or West End. In the aforementioned mixes the beat of the record was accentuated, \"unnecessary\" vocal parts dropped, and other DJ-friendly features making it easy to work with, like picking out key sections to play over other records, heightening the dancefloor effect. Contemporary instances are also called \"dubtronica\", \"dub-techno\", \"steppers\" or electronic music influenced by dub music.[28] Yale professor Michael Veal described dub as \"the sound of a society tearing itself apart at the seams\". His book, \"Starship Africa\", says that the African diaspora is reflected in dub by the \"extensive use of reverberation/delay devices and the fragmentation of the song surface\" – he considers dub's use of reverb a \"sonic metaphor for the condition of diaspora.\" Veal wrote that dub creators used echo and reverb to elicit memories of African culture in their listeners.[29] King Tubby, Lee Perry, Erroll Thompson, Mad Professor, Jah Shaka, Denis Bovell and Linton Kwesi Johnson influenced rock musicians. From the 1980s forward, dub has been influenced by, and has in turn influenced, techno, dubtronica/dub techno, jungle, drum and bass, dubstep, house music, punk and post-punk, trip hop, ambient music, and hip hop, with electronic dub sound. Musicians and bands such as Culture Club,[30] Bill Laswell, Jah Wobble, New Age Steppers,[31] Public Image Ltd, The Pop Group, The Police, Massive Attack, The Clash, Adrian Sherwood, Killing Joke,[32] Bauhaus and others demonstrate clear dub influences in their respective genres, and their innovations have in turn influenced the mainstream of the dub genre. In 1987, US grunge rock band Soundgarden released a dub version of the Ohio Players' song \"Fopp\" alongside a more traditional rock cover of the song.[33] DJs appeared towards the end of the 1990s who specialised in playing music by these musicians, such as the UK's Unity Dub. In the UK, Europe, and America, independent record producers continue to produce dub. Before forming The Mars Volta, Cedric Bixler, Omar Rodriguez and other members, recorded a series of dub albums under the name De Facto since 1999. Since the inception of dub in the late 1960s, its history has been intertwined with that of the punk rock scene in the UK. The Clash worked on collaborations involving Jamaican dub reggae creators like Lee \"Scratch\" Perry (whose \"Police & Thieves\", co-written with Junior Murvin, was covered by the Clash on their first album) and Mikey Dread (on the Sandinista! album). As well, the English group Ruts DC, a post-Malcolm Owen incarnation of the legendary reggae influenced punk group The Ruts, released Rhythm Collision Dub Volume 1 (Roir session), with the expertise of the Mad Professor. Many punk rock bands In the U.S. were exposed to dub via the rasta punk band Bad Brains from Washington, D.C., which was established and released their most influential material during the 1980s. Blind Idiot God placed dub music alongside their faster and more intense noise rock tracks. Dub was adopted by some punk rock groups of the 90s, with bands such as Rancid and NOFX writing original songs in a dub style.[34] Often, bands considered to be ska punk play dub influenced songs; one of the first such bands to become popular was Sublime, whose albums featured both dub originals and remixes. They went on to influence more recent American bands such as Rx Bandits and The Long Beach Dub Allstars. In addition, dub influenced some types of pop, including bands such as No Doubt. No Doubt's fifth album, Rock Steady, features an assortment of popular dub sounds like reverb and echoing. As noted by the band themselves, No Doubt is heavily influenced by Jamaican musical aesthetics and production techniques, even recording their Rock Steady album in Kingston, Jamaica, and producing B-sides featuring dub influences on their Everything in Time B-sides album. Some controversy still exists on whether pop-ska bands like No Doubt can regard themselves as a part of dub lineage. Other bands followed in the footsteps of No Doubt, fusing pop-ska and dub influences, such as Save Ferris and Vincent. There are also some British punk bands creating dub music. Capdown released their Civil Disobedients album, featuring the track \"Dub No.", "<4-hop>\n\n1\", while Sonic Boom Six and The King Blues take heavy influences from dub, mixing the genre with original punk ethics and attitudes. The post-punk band Public Image Ltd, fronted by John Lydon, formerly of Sex Pistols, often use dub and reggae influenced bass lines in their music, especially in their earlier music through various bassists who were members of the group, such as Jah Wobble and Jonas Hellborg. Their track \"Rise\", which reached No. 11 in the UK Chart in 1986 uses a dub/reggae influenced bass line. The British post-punk band Bauhaus were highly influenced by dub music, so far that Bauhaus' bass player, David J mentioned that their signature song, \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", \"was our interpretation of dub\".[35][36][37] Shoegaze bands such as Ride with their song \"King Bullshit\" and the intro to \"Time Machine\" have explored and experimented with dub. Slowdive also penned \"Souvlaki Space Station\" and their instrumental \"Moussaka Chaos\" as a testimony of dub influence, while the Kitchens of Distinction released \"Anvil Dub\". Steve Hogarth, singer with British rock band Marillion, acknowledged the influence of dub on their 2001 album Anoraknophobia.[38] Al Cisneros, founder and bassist of Doom Metal outfit OM has gone on record regarding the influence of Reggae and Dub on his bass playing style.[39] Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators of dub such as Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Mad Professor have produced music in the 21st century. New artists continue to preserve the traditional dub sound, some with slight modifications but with a primary focus on reproducing the original characteristics of the sound in a live environment. Some of these artists include Dubblestandart from Vienna, Austria (who recorded the album Return from Planet Dub in collaboration with, and performing live with, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry); Liquid Stranger from Sweden; New York City artists, including Ticklah (also known as Victor Axelrod, Earl Maxton, Calbert Walker, and Douglass & Degraw), Victor Rice, Easy Star All-Stars, and Dub Trio—who have recorded and performed live with Mike Patton and are currently touring as the backing band for Matisyahu); Subatomic Sound System (who have remixed material by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Ari Up); Dub Is a Weapon; King Django; Dr. Israel; Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad from Rochester, New York; the Heavyweight Dub Champion from San Francisco and Colorado, Gaudi; Ott from the UK, who has released several influential albums through Twisted Records, Boom One Sound System, and Dubsmith from the Boom One Records label; Future Pigeon from Los Angeles; German artists like Disrupt and Rootah from the Jahtari label; Twilight Circus from the Netherlands; Moonlight Dub Experiment from Costa Rica; and Stand High Patrol from France. More eclectic use of dub techniques are apparent in the work of BudNubac, which mixes Cuban big band with dub techniques. Modern dub producer Ryan Moore has received critical acclaim for his Twilight Circus project. In 2022 was released Sly & Robbie vs. Roots Radics \"The Dub Battle\" produced by the Argentine artist and dub engineer Hernan \"Don Camel\" Sforzini, this work is the first to reunite all the legends of dub in one album dubbing the entire \"The Final Battle\" album, Grammy nominated in 2019. This album includes the last dubs produced by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Bunny \"Striker\" Lee, also dub versions produced by King Jammy, Mad Professor, Dennis Bovell, Don Camel and two unreleased dub versions of King Tubby.[40] Dub music is in conversation with the cultural aesthetic of Afrofuturism. Having emerged from Jamaica, this genre is regarded as the product of diaspora peoples, whose culture reflects the experience of dislocation, alienation and remembrance. Through the creation of space-filling soundscapes, faded echoes, and repetition within musical tracks, Dub artists are able to tap into such Afrofuturist concepts as the nonlinearity of time and the projection of past sounds into an unknown future space. In a 1982 essay,[41] Luke Ehrlich describes Dub through this particular scope: With dub, Jamaican music spaced out completely. If reggae is Africa in the New World, then dub must be Africa on the moon; it's the psychedelic music I expected to hear in the '60s and didn't. The bass and drums conjure up a dark, vast space, a musical portrait of outer space, with sounds suspended like glowing planets or the fragments of instruments careening by, leaving trails like comets and meteors. Dub is a kaleidoscopic musical montage which takes sounds originally intended as interlocking parts of another arrangement and using them as raw material, converts them into new and different sounds; then, in its own rhythm and format, it continually reshuffles these new sounds into unusual juxtapositions. At the same time, dub music's role in the Black musical canon marks a theme of the diaspora the music was birthed from. Due to the sonic structure of echoes and reverberations, dub can create a dream-like world symbolizing the generational trauma of African diaspora as a result of slavery.[42] This understanding of dub gives it the power to take on the darker emotions related to the diaspora, including violence. In King Tubby's dub mixes, one can hear sonic elements of screeching tires, gun fire, and police sirens.[43] Artist Arthur Jafa said this about dub music and the diaspora in 1994 during a keynote address at the Organization of Black Designers Conference:[43] those group experiences that reconfigure who we [African Americans] are as a community. One of the critical primal sites would be the Middle Passage. If you understand the level of horror directed towards a group of people, then you start getting some sense of the magnitude, impact, and level of trauma that that had on the African American community, and how it was particularly one of the earliest group experiences that reshaped an \"African psyche\" into the beginning of an African American psyche. . . . Now, for example, you look at Black music and see certain structural things that really are about reclaiming this whole sense of absence, loss, not knowing. One of the things I'm thinking about is dub music"], "reference": "Dub music, which grew out of reggae, is related to Afrofuturism because it reflects the experience of diaspora peoples through space-filling soundscapes, faded echoes, and repetition, tapping into concepts like the nonlinearity of time.

It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style.[1] Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings[2] created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, emphasis of the rhythm section (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a riddim), the application of studio effects such as echo and reverb, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.[3] Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock, Hopeton \"Scientist\" Brown, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others[1] beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy.[4] These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.[5] Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk,[6] pop,[7] hip hop,[6] post-disco, and later house,[8] techno,[8] ambient,[8] electronic dance music,[9] and trip hop.[8] Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass, as well as a major influence on dubstep, with its orientation around bass and utilization of audio effects.[10][11][12] Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material.

The British post-punk band Bauhaus were highly influenced by dub music, so far that Bauhaus' bass player, David J mentioned that their signature song, \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", \"was our interpretation of dub\".[35][36][37] Shoegaze bands such as Ride with their song \"King Bullshit\" and the intro to \"Time Machine\" have explored and experimented with dub. Slowdive also penned \"Souvlaki Space Station\" and their instrumental \"Moussaka Chaos\" as a testimony of dub influence, while the Kitchens of Distinction released \"Anvil Dub\". Steve Hogarth, singer with British rock band Marillion, acknowledged the influence of dub on their 2001 album Anoraknophobia.[38] Al Cisneros, founder and bassist of Doom Metal outfit OM has gone on record regarding the influence of Reggae and Dub on his bass playing style.[39] Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators of dub such as Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Mad Professor have produced music in the 21st century. New artists continue to preserve the traditional dub sound, some with slight modifications but with a primary focus on reproducing the original characteristics of the sound in a live environment. Some of these artists include Dubblestandart from Vienna, Austria (who recorded the album Return from Planet Dub in collaboration with, and performing live with, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry); Liquid Stranger from Sweden; New York City artists, including Ticklah (also known as Victor Axelrod, Earl Maxton, Calbert Walker, and Douglass & Degraw), Victor Rice, Easy Star All-Stars, and Dub Trio—who have recorded and performed live with Mike Patton and are currently touring as the backing band for Matisyahu); Subatomic Sound System (who have remixed material by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Ari Up); Dub Is a Weapon; King Django; Dr. Israel; Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad from Rochester, New York; the Heavyweight Dub Champion from San Francisco and Colorado, Gaudi; Ott from the UK, who has released several influential albums through Twisted Records, Boom One Sound System, and Dubsmith from the Boom One Records label; Future Pigeon from Los Angeles; German artists like Disrupt and Rootah from the Jahtari label; Twilight Circus from the Netherlands; Moonlight Dub Experiment from Costa Rica; and Stand High Patrol from France. More eclectic use of dub techniques are apparent in the work of BudNubac, which mixes Cuban big band with dub techniques. Modern dub producer Ryan Moore has received critical acclaim for his Twilight Circus project. In 2022 was released Sly & Robbie vs. Roots Radics \"The Dub Battle\" produced by the Argentine artist and dub engineer Hernan \"Don Camel\" Sforzini, this work is the first to reunite all the legends of dub in one album dubbing the entire \"The Final Battle\" album, Grammy nominated in 2019. This album includes the last dubs produced by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Bunny \"Striker\" Lee, also dub versions produced by King Jammy, Mad Professor, Dennis Bovell, Don Camel and two unreleased dub versions of King Tubby.[40] Dub music is in conversation with the cultural aesthetic of Afrofuturism. Having emerged from Jamaica, this genre is regarded as the product of diaspora peoples, whose culture reflects the experience of dislocation, alienation and remembrance. Through the creation of space-filling soundscapes, faded echoes, and repetition within musical tracks, Dub artists are able to tap into such Afrofuturist concepts as the nonlinearity of time and the projection of past sounds into an unknown future space. In a 1982 essay,[41] Luke Ehrlich describes Dub through this particular scope: With dub, Jamaican music spaced out completely. If reggae is Africa in the New World, then dub must be Africa on the moon; it's the psychedelic music I expected to hear in the '60s and didn't. The bass and drums conjure up a dark, vast space, a musical portrait of outer space, with sounds suspended like glowing planets or the fragments of instruments careening by, leaving trails like comets and meteors. Dub is a kaleidoscopic musical montage which takes sounds originally intended as interlocking parts of another arrangement and using them as raw material, converts them into new and different sounds; then, in its own rhythm and format, it continually reshuffles these new sounds into unusual juxtapositions. At the same time, dub music's role in the Black musical canon marks a theme of the diaspora the music was birthed from. Due to the sonic structure of echoes and reverberations, dub can create a dream-like world symbolizing the generational trauma of African diaspora as a result of slavery.[42] This understanding of dub gives it the power to take on the darker emotions related to the diaspora, including violence. In King Tubby's dub mixes, one can hear sonic elements of screeching tires, gun fire, and police sirens.[43] Artist Arthur Jafa said this about dub music and the diaspora in 1994 during a keynote address at the Organization of Black Designers Conference:[43] those group experiences that reconfigure who we [African Americans] are as a community. One of the critical primal sites would be the Middle Passage. If you understand the level of horror directed towards a group of people, then you start getting some sense of the magnitude, impact, and level of trauma that that had on the African American community, and how it was particularly one of the earliest group experiences that reshaped an \"African psyche\" into the beginning of an African American psyche. . . . Now, for example, you look at Black music and see certain structural things that really are about reclaiming this whole sense of absence, loss, not knowing. One of the things I'm thinking about is dub music"], "reference": "Dub music, originating from reggae, significantly influenced various genres, including post-punk.

Recordings circulated on cassette or Internet blogs and were typically marked by the use of outmoded analog equipment and DIY experimentation. The genre's name was coined by journalist David Keenan in an August 2009 issue of The Wire to label the developing trend, which he characterized as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory.\"[7] It was used interchangeably with \"chillwave\" or \"glo-fi\" and gained critical attention through artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro.[5] The music has been variously described as a 21st-century update of psychedelia, a reappropriation of media-saturated capitalist culture, and an \"American cousin\" to British hauntology. In response to Keenan's article, The Wire received a slew of hate mail that derided hypnagogic pop as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\".[5] Some of the tagged artists rejected the label or denied that such a unified style exists.[5] During the 2010s, critical attention for the genre waned, although the style's \"revisionist nostalgia\" sublimated into various youth-oriented cultural zeitgeists. Hypnagogic pop evolved into vaporwave, with which it is sometimes conflated. Hypnagogic pop is pop or psychedelic music that draws heavily from the popular music and culture of the 1980s[8][6][9] – also ranging from the 1970s[10] to the early 1990s.[11] The genre reflects a preoccupation with outmoded analog technology and bombastic representations of synthetic elements from these epochs of pop culture, with its creators informed by collective memory as well as their personal histories.[12] Per the imprecise nature of memory, the genre does not faithfully recreate the sounds and styles popular in those periods.[1] In this way, hypnagogic pop distinguishes itself from revivalist movements. As authors Maël Guesdon and Philippe Le Guern write, the genre can be described as \"revisionist nostalgia, not in the sense that 'everything used to be better' but because it rewrites collective memory with a view to being more faithful to an idea or a memory of the original than to the original itself.\"[13] Examples of specific sounds evoked by hypnagogic pop artists range from \"ecstatically blurry and irradiated lo-fi pop\" to \"seventies cosmic-synth-rock\" and \"tripped-out, tribal exotica\".[14] Writing for Vice in 2011, Morgan Poyau described the genre as \"making awkward bedfellows out of experimental music enthusiasts and weird progressive pop theorists.\"[15] He described a typical manifestation of the style as featuring long tracks \"saturated with echo, delay, smothered guitars and amputated synths.\"[15] Critic Adam Trainer writes that, rather than a particular sound, the music was defined by a collection of artists who shared the same approaches and cultural experiences.

Trainer disagreed with Reynolds' assertion and said the style \"arguably\" emerged from numerous simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of \"post-noise neo-psychedelia\".[25] Pitchfork's Marc Masters offered that it may have originated \"less [as] a movement than a coincidence\".[26] The music was often issued in the form of limited-edition cassettes or vinyl records before reaching a wider audience through blogs and YouTube videos.[9] Ariel Pink gained recognition in the mid-2000s through a string of self-produced albums, pioneering a sound that Reynolds called \"'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering in and out of the fog\".[27] He identified Pink and the Skaters as the \"godparents of hypnagogic\",[28] but singled out Pink as the central figure to what he calls the \"Altered Zones Generation\", an umbrella term he designed for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, an associate site for Pitchfork.[19][nb 1] Tiny Mix Tapes' Jordan Redmond wrote that Pink's early collaborator John Maus was also placed \"at the nexus of a number of recent popular movements\" including hypnagogic pop, and that Maus was as \"much of a progenitor of this sound as Pink, even though Pink has tended to be the headline-grabber.\"[30] R.

He observed that their music drew from \"the collective unconscious of late 1980s and early 1990s popular culture\" while being \"indebted stylistically to various traditions of experimentalism such as noise, drone, repetition, and improvisation.\"[16] Common reference points include various forms of 1980s music, including radio rock, new wave pop, MTV one-hit wonders, New Age music, synth-driven Hollywood blockbuster soundtracks,[9] lounge music, easy-listening, corporate muzak, lite rock \"schmaltz\", video game music,[1] and 1980s synth-pop and R&B.[5][17] Recordings are often deliberately degraded, produced with analog equipment, and exhibit recording idiosyncrasies such as tape hiss.[11] It employs sounds that were considered \"futuristic\" during the 1980s which, due to their outmoded nature, appear psychedelic out of context.[11] Also common was the use of outmoded audiovisual technology and DIY digital imagery, such as compact cassettes, VHS, CD-R discs, and early Internet aesthetics.[18] In the 2000s, a wave of retro-inspired home-recording artists began dominating underground indie scenes.[19] The emergence of Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, in particular, prompted journalistic discussion of the philosophical concept of hauntology,[20] most prominently among the writers Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher.[21] Later, the term \"hauntology\" was described as a British synonym for hypnagogic pop,[3] while hypnagogic pop was described as an \"American cousin\" to Britain's hauntological music scene,[22][1][23] Todd Ledford, owner of the music label Olde English Spelling Bee (OESB), attributed a correlation between the proliferation of hypnagogic pop and the rise of YouTube.[24] Reynolds attributed the origins of hypnagogic pop to Southern California and its culture. Trainer disagreed with Reynolds' assertion and said the style \"arguably\" emerged from numerous simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of \"post-noise neo-psychedelia\".[25] Pitchfork's Marc Masters offered that it may have originated \"less [as] a movement than a coincidence\".[26] The music was often issued in the form of limited-edition cassettes or vinyl records before reaching a wider audience through blogs and YouTube videos.[9] Ariel Pink gained recognition in the mid-2000s through a string of self-produced albums, pioneering a sound that Reynolds called \"'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering in and out of the fog\".[27] He identified Pink and the Skaters as the \"godparents of hypnagogic\",[28] but singled out Pink as the central figure to what he calls the \"Altered Zones Generation\", an umbrella term he designed for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, an associate site for Pitchfork.[19][nb 1] Tiny Mix Tapes' Jordan Redmond wrote that Pink's early collaborator John Maus was also placed \"at the nexus of a number of recent popular movements\" including hypnagogic pop, and that Maus was as \"much of a progenitor of this sound as Pink, even though Pink has tended to be the headline-grabber.\"[30] R. Stevie Moore and Martin Newell were earlier artists who anticipated Pink's sound.[19] Matthew Ingram of The Wire recognized Moore's influence on Pink and hypnagogic pop: \"through his disciple ... he has unwittingly provided the [genre's] template\".[31][nb 2] Another precursor to the genre was Nick Nicely and his 1982 single \"Hilly Fields (1892)\". Red Bull Music's J.R. Moore wrote that Nicely's \"uniquely haphazard DIY aesthetic\"", "<2-hop>\n\nand contemporary take on 1960s psychedelic pop \"basically invented the sound of the 2000s Hypnagogic Pop movement decades beforehand.\"[33][nb 3] The Skaters were a noise duo consisting of James Ferraro and Spencer Clark, and like Pink, were based in California.[34] In the mid-2000s, they released dozens of CD-Rs and cassettes of psychedelic drone music, after which Ferraro and Clark each pursued solo outings.[11] From 2009 to 2010, Ferraro's music evolved to be increasingly rhythmic and melodic, as Trainer describes, \"an oversaturated sonic palette of cheesy pop reminiscent of early video game soundtracks and 1980s Saturday morning cartoons.\"[35] Complex contributor Joe Price felt that the h-pop movement was \"birthed\" by Ferraro and \"the vastly overlooked [Missouri artist] 18 Carat Affair\".[36] In Reynolds' description, \"other rising figures\" from the original California scene included Sun Araw, LA Vampires and Puro Instinct. He added: \"Other key hypnagogues such as Matrix Metals and Rangers reside elsewhere but seem SoCal in spirit.\"[9] In a 2009 interview, Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) stated that Salvador Dalí and Danny Wolfers were the \"godfathers of hpop\". He identified other progenitors to be DJ Screw, \"retro kids\", Joe Wenderoth, Autre Ne Veut, Church In Moon and DJ Dog Dick.[37] Journalist David Keenan, who was known as a reporter of noise, freak folk, and drone music scenes, coined \"hypnagogic pop\" in an August 2009 piece for The Wire.[14] Keenan applied the label to a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists engaged with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outdated recording technology. Inspired by comments by James Ferraro and Spencer Clark, and while invoking a similar concept discussed by Russian esotericist P.D. Ouspensky, Keenan employed the term \"hypnagogic\" as referring to the psychological state \"between waking and sleeping, liminal zones where mis-hearings and hallucinations feed into the formation of dreams.\"[11] The term reportedly originated with a comment by James Ferraro about the notion that 1980s sounds had seeped into the unconscious of contemporary musicians while they were toddlers falling asleep and their parents played music in another room.[38][page needed] Among the artists discussed in Keenan's article were Ariel Pink, Daniel Lopatin, the Skaters, the Savage Young Taterbug, Gary War, Zola Jesus, Ducktails, Emeralds, and Pocahaunted.[11][nb 4] According to Keenan, these artists drew on cultural sources subconsciously remembered from their 1980s and early 1990s adolescence while freeing them from their historical contexts and \"hom[ing] in on the futuristic signifiers\" of the period.[11] He alternately summarized hypnagogic pop as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory\" and as \"1980's-inspired psychedelia\" that engages with capitalist detritus of the past in an attempt to \"dream of the future.\"[11] In a later article, Keenan identified Lopatin, Ferraro, Clark, and ex-Test Icicles member Sam Mehran as hypnagogic pop's \"most adventurous proponents\".[39] Once \"hypnagogic pop\" was coined, a variety of music blogs wrote about the phenomenon.[15] By 2010, albums by Ariel Pink and Neon Indian were regularly hailed by publications like Pitchfork and The Wire, with \"hypnagogic pop\", \"chillwave\", and \"glo-fi\" employed to describe the evolving sounds of such artists, a number of which had songs of considerable success within independent music circles.[5] Pink was frequently called \"godfather\" of h-pop, chillwave or glo-fi as new acts that were associated with him (aesthetically, personally, geographically, or professionally) attracted notice from critics.[41] Some of his contemporaries, such as Ferraro, Clark, and War, failed to match his mainstream success. When this point was raised to Clark in a 2013 interview, he replied that Pink was simply \"an ambassador of California, like the Beach Boys.\"[42] In 2010, Pitchfork launched Altered Zones, effectively an online newsletter for hypnagogic acts.[39] Beginning that July, Altered Zones aggregated its content from a collective of leading blogs specializing in the movement.[14] By the end of the year, OESB, now known for its roster of hypnagogic acts such as Ferraro and Mehran, had grown to be one of the most prominent underground indie labels.[24] In January 2011, Keenan wrote that OESB was \"the imprint most associated with H-pop\" and \"in many ways ... the label of 2010\", although he mused, \"[I]ts demographic has morphed from an early underground/Noise audience to being embraced by the fringes of indie and dance culture, helped by groups like Forest Swords, who muddy the line between H-pop and dubstep.\"[39] \"Chillwave\", a tag used to describe a similar trend,[43] was coined one month before Keenan's 2009 article[44] and was adopted synonymously with \"hypnagogic pop\".[45] While the two styles are similar in that they both evoke 1980s–90s imagery, chillwave has a more commercial sound with an emphasis on \"cheesy\" hooks and reverb effects.[46] A contemporary review by Marc Hogan for Neon Indian's Psychic Chasms (2009) listed \"dream-beat\", \"chillwave\", \"glo-fi\", \"hypnagogic pop\", and \"hipster-gogic pop\" as interchangeable terms for \"psychedelic music that's generally one or all of the following: synth-based, homemade-sounding, 80s-referencing, cassette-oriented, sun-baked, laid-back, warped, hazy, emotionally distant, slightly out of focus.\"[47] The experimental tendencies of hypnagogic pop artists like Pink and Ferraro were soon amplified by the Internet-centric genre dubbed \"vaporwave\". Although the name shares the \"-wave\" suffix, it is only loosely connected to chillwave.[4] Sam Mehran was one of the earliest hypnagogic acts to anticipate vaporwave, with his project Matrix Metals and the 2009 album Flamingo Breeze, which was built on synthesizer loops.[48] That same year, Lopatin uploaded a collection of plunderphonics loops to YouTube inconspicuously under the alias sunsetcorp. These clips were later assembled for the album Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 (2010).[36] Stereogum's Miles Bowe summarized vaporwave as a combination of \"the chopped and screwed plunderphonics of Dan Lopatin ... with the nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraro’s Muzak-hellscapes on [the 2011 album] Far Side Virtual\".[4][nb 5] Writers, fans, and artists struggled to differentiate between hypnagogic pop, chillwave, and vaporwave.[50] The term \"vaporwave\" is generally attributed to an October 2011 blog post that discussed the hypnagogic album Surfs Pure Hearts by Girlhood.[50] Adam Harper surmised that the author cited the work as \"vaporwave\" instead of \"hypnagogic pop\" possibly because they were unfamiliar with the latter"], "reference": "James Ferraro, along with Spencer Clark as part of The Skaters, released numerous CD-Rs and cassettes of psychedelic drone music in the mid-2000s.

It emerged in the mid to late 2000s as American lo-fi and noise musicians began adopting retro aesthetics remembered from their childhood, such as radio rock, new wave pop, synth-pop, video game music, light rock, and R&B. Recordings circulated on cassette or Internet blogs and were typically marked by the use of outmoded analog equipment and DIY experimentation. The genre's name was coined by journalist David Keenan in an August 2009 issue of The Wire to label the developing trend, which he characterized as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory.\"[7] It was used interchangeably with \"chillwave\" or \"glo-fi\" and gained critical attention through artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro.[5] The music has been variously described as a 21st-century update of psychedelia, a reappropriation of media-saturated capitalist culture, and an \"American cousin\" to British hauntology. In response to Keenan's article, The Wire received a slew of hate mail that derided hypnagogic pop as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\".[5] Some of the tagged artists rejected the label or denied that such a unified style exists.[5] During the 2010s, critical attention for the genre waned, although the style's \"revisionist nostalgia\" sublimated into various youth-oriented cultural zeitgeists.
