Texas country is a style of Western music and is often associated with other distinct neighboring styles,[1] including Red Dirt from Oklahoma,[2] the New Mexico music of New Mexico,[3] and Tejano in Texas,[4] all of which have influenced one another over the years, and are popular throughout Texas, the Midwest, the Southwest, and other parts of the Western United States. Texas Country is known for fusing neotraditional country with the outspoken, care-free views of outlaw country. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a \"common working man\" theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound. Neither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas-based. For example, Chris Knight is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his Kentucky ties. Adam Hood, an Alabama native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as Alberta, Canada native Corb Lund, have been successful in the Texas Country scene. The acoustic guitar is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of electric guitars, steel guitars or pedal steel guitars in the genre is not uncommon. Bass and percussion are used in live performances. The sounds of piano, baritone guitar, banjo, accordion, fiddle or harmonica on studio recordings are the norm for the genre. The line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas music charts.[5] The live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene. Enthusiasm is the best descriptor for both band and crowd at a live Texas Country performance. \"It is not an uncommon sight to see clubs all over Texas packed to the rafters; girls and boys in cowboy hats and Wranglers two-stepping next to the mosh pit, where college boys or \"Man Fans\" in khakis and college girls pressed up against the stage\".[6] An important factor Texas Country's success is in the frequency of live performances. It is not uncommon for a Texas Country band to tour 200+ dates a year, all, or nearly all, in the State of Texas[citation needed]. This allows the fan to attend a band's show more often, thus interacting with the music on a more personal level. Popular venues include, Gruene Hall (Gruene), Billy Bob's (Ft. Worth), Cowboys Red River[7] (Dallas and San Antonio), John T. Floore's Country Store[8] (Helotes), Luckenbach Dance Hall (near Fredericksburg), and Blue Light Live[9] (Lubbock). In addition to local and state wide venues hosting live performances, the Texas Regional Radio Report hosts the annual Texas Regional Radio Music Awards Show where the Texas Red Dirt artist and radio stations are recognized for the outstanding achievements throughout the year. The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show. The voting membership has grown to over 32,000 voting members in five years and continues to expand every year. The awards show is open to the public and fans alike who cheer on their favorite artist/entertainers and radio stations.

{"user_input": "Considering the Outlaw country movement and the subsequent rise of Texas Country, could you elaborate on the specific contributions of Texan artists who, like George Strait, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and David Allan Coe, retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to places like Austin, Luckenbach, and Houston, and how their actions shaped the Texas music scene?", "reference_contexts": ["Texas Country's roots lie in the Outlaw country movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Texan artists such as George Strait, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, David Allan Coe retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to Austin, Luckenbach, and Houston. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff Walker, Gary P. Nunn, Steve Young, Kris Kristofferson, Joe Ely, Terry Allen, Steve Earle, and Townes Van Zandt. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts[citation needed]. These artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as Robert Earl Keen, Lyle Lovett, Wayne Hancock,Kevin Fowler, Roger Creager, Pat Green, Cory Morrow, Radney Foster, Max Stalling, Wade Bowen George Ducas, Randy Rogers, & Rich O’Toole. While the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as Jason Boland, Stoney LaRue, Mike McClure, and Cross Canadian Ragweed have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states. George Strait has the most songs about Texas. “Amarillo by Morning” and “All My Exes Live In Texas” are his most popular Texas songs. Robert Earl Keen's No. 2 Live Dinner, released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".[14] Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable. His 1996 live album release truly showcased the “wide range” of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. Joe Ely and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of “The Road Goes On Forever”. Cory Morrow, a Houston native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album Outside the Lines, Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.[15][citation needed] Pat Green, also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album Wave on Wave after switching to a \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music. The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart and won a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. Kevin Fowler, a former hair-metal/glam rocker was Dangerous Toys guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from Amarillo, he self-released his country debut album One For The Road in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, Beer, Bait, and Ammo. He has since found national success, on a major label. Texas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as Jack Ingram, who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a CMT Music Award in 2007 and the 2008 Academy of Country Music award for New Male Vocalist of the Year. He has also scored top 25 singles on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"Love You\" and his cover of Hinder's \"Lips of an Angel\".

{"user_input": "Now, I understand that country pop, or urban cowboy as some call it, has roots that go way back. Could you elaborate on how Nashville, Tennessee, played a pivotal role in the genesis of this genre, particularly concerning the development of what became known as the Nashville Sound?", "reference_contexts": ["Country pop (also known as urban cowboy) is a fusion genre of country music and pop music that was developed by members of the country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. Country pop music blends genres like rock, pop, and country, continuing similar efforts that began in the late 1950s, known originally as the Nashville sound and later on as Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound, which led to some records charting high on the mainstream top 40 and the Billboard country chart. In turn, many pop and easy listening artists crossed over to country charts during this time. After declining in popularity during the neotraditional movement of the 1980s, country pop had a comeback in the 1990s with a sound that drew more heavily on pop rock and adult contemporary. In the 2010s, country pop metamorphosized again with the addition of hip-hop beats and rap-style phrasing. The joining of country and pop began in the 1950s when studio executives Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley wanted to create a new kind of music for the young adult crowd after \"rockabilly stole away much of country music's youth audience\".[2] According to Bill Ivey, this innovative genre originated in Nashville, Tennessee and thus became known as the Nashville Sound. He believes that the \"Nashville Sound often produced records that sounded more pop than country\" after the removal of the fiddle and banjo. Patsy Cline, Marty Robbins, Jim Reeves, and Eddy Arnold were among the most popular artists during this time.[3] Both Reeves and Arnold had major influence on their RCA labelmate Elvis Presley, apparent not only in secular songs but even more so in country gospel songs. Cline became famous in the early 1960s, gaining widespread acceptance from country and pop audiences alike. Other crossover hits during the 1960s included Skeeter Davis's \"The End of the World\", Sonny James' \"Young Love\", Billy Joe Royal's \"Down in the Boondocs\",Jeannie C. Riley's \"Harper Valley PTA\", and Bobby Goldsboro's \"Honey\".[4] However, the Nashville Sound was not well received by country purists and faced competition on that front, first from the Bakersfield Sound and later the outlaw movement; on the pop side, the format was overshadowed by the British Invasion, which was taking place during the same time that Cline and Reeves died by airplane accident. The Nashville sound eventually evolved into countrypolitan during the 1970s and had varying levels of success, with several artists recording in the style: Ray Price (\"For the Good Times\" 1970), Lynn Anderson (\"Rose Garden\" 1970), Charley Pride (\"Kiss an Angel Good Morning\" 1971), Mac Davis (\"Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me\" 1972), Donna Fargo (\"The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A.\" 1972 and \"Funny Face\" 1973), Marie Osmond (\"Paper Roses\" 1973), Kris Kristofferson (\"Why Me\" 1973), Charlie Rich (\"The Most Beautiful Girl\" 1974), Billy Swan (\"I Can Help\" 1974), Ray Stevens (\"The Streak\" 1974), Jessi Colter (\"I'm Not Lisa\" 1975), and Crystal Gayle (\"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" 1977) all charted pop-influenced country hits during the 1970s.[5] Country pop started when pop music singers like Glen Campbell, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, and Anne Murray (Canada) began having hits on the country charts. Denver's single \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" went to No. 2 on the Billboard pop charts in 1971, and while the song stalled outside of the top 40 on Billboard's country chart, the album Poems, Prayers, and Promises reached the top 10 on the Billboard Country Album chart and was certified Platinum.[6][7] Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten pop album with Rocky Mountain High, with its title track reaching the pop Top Ten in 1973.[8] At the peak of his popularity in 1974 and 1975, Denver's albums Back Home Again and Windsong reached number one on both the pop and country album charts. His singles were also successful on both charts: \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\" No. 1 pop, No. 42 country; \"Annie's Song\" No. 1 pop, No. 9 country; \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\" No. 1 pop and country; \"Back Home Again\" No. 5 pop, No. 1 country; and \"I'm Sorry\" No. 1 pop and country. Another 1970s crossover artist was Olivia Newton-John, who emerged from Australia in the mid-1970s, hoping to make it big in the United States. Her single \"Let Me Be There\" became a big pop-country crossover hit in 1974. She won a Grammy award for \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" for the song and also won the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" (beating out established Nashville artists Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, and Tanya Tucker, as well as Canadian transplant Anne Murray). Her win sparked a backlash, with several traditional country artists forming the Association of Country Entertainers (ACE) to promote what they considered to be \"real country music.\"[9] Newton-John scored a string of pop-country hits in 1974 and 1975 including \"I Honestly Love You\", \"Have You Never Been Mellow\", and \"Please Mr. Please\", before moving away from country in the late 1970s after starring in Grease and focusing mostly on pop music from then onward. The debate raged into 1975 and reached its apex at that year's Country Music Association Awards when reigning Entertainer of the Year Charlie Rich (who himself had a series of crossover hits) presented the award to his successor, John Denver. As he read Denver's name, Rich set fire to the envelope with a cigarette lighter. The ACE would only last two years; its two biggest backers, firm traditionalists George Jones and Tammy Wynette, faced a bitter divorce, and Jean Shepard, the other major backer of the ACE, closed down the organization when she could not find others that shared her enthusiasm for the association's purpose.[10] Although known primarily as a rock performer in the 1970s, Linda Ronstadt had considerable country chart success with \"I Can't Help"], "reference": "According to Bill Ivey, the innovative genre of country pop originated in Nashville, Tennessee, and thus became known as the Nashville Sound.

{"user_input": "Considering the impact of noise pollution on urban environments, how can urban planning and soundscape design be used to mitigate unwanted sounds and enhance the positive effects of natural sounds, particularly in creating quiet areas within cities?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nA soundscape is the acoustic environment as perceived by humans, in context. The term, originally coined by Michael Southworth,[1] was popularized by R. Murray Schafer.[2] There is a varied history of the use of soundscape depending on discipline, ranging from urban design to wildlife ecology to computer science.[3] An important distinction is to separate soundscape from the broader acoustic environment. The acoustic environment is the combination of all the acoustic resources, natural and artificial, within a given area as modified by the environment. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standardized these definitions in 2014. (ISO 12913-1:2014) A soundscape is a sound or combination of sounds that forms or arises from an immersive environment. The study of soundscape is the subject of acoustic ecology or soundscape ecology. The idea of soundscape refers to both the natural acoustic environment, consisting of natural sounds, including animal vocalizations, the collective habitat expression of which is now referred to as the biophony, and, for instance, the sounds of weather and other natural elements, now referred to as the geophony; and environmental sounds created by humans, the anthropophony. The anthropophony comprises a sub-set called controlled sound, such as musical composition, sound design, and language, work, and sounds of mechanical origin resulting from use of industrial technology. Crucially, the term soundscape also includes the listener's perception of sounds heard as an environment, which Truax describes as \"how that environment is understood by those living within it\"[4] and therefore mediates their relations. The disruption of these acoustic environments results in noise pollution.[5] The term \"soundscape\" can also refer to an audio recording or performance of sounds that create the sensation of experiencing a particular acoustic environment, or compositions created using the found sounds (sounds derived from objects not standardly used for music) of an acoustic environment, either exclusively or in conjunction with musical performances.[6][7] Pauline Oliveros, composer of post-World War II electronic art music, defined the term \"soundscape\" as \"All of the waveforms faithfully transmitted to our audio cortex by the ear and its mechanisms\".[8] The origin of the term soundscape is somewhat ambiguous. It is often miscredited as having been coined by Canadian composer and naturalist, R. Murray Schafer, who led much of the groundbreaking work on the subject from the 1960s and onwards. According to an interview with Schafer published in 2013,[9] Schafer himself attributes the term to city planner Michael Southworth. Southworth, a former student of Kevin Lynch, led a project in Boston in the 1960s, and reported the findings in a paper entitled \"The Sonic Environment of Cities\" in 1969,[1] where the term is used. Around the same time as Southworth's project in Boston, Schafer initiated the World Soundscape Project together with colleagues Barry Truax and Hildegard Westerkamp. Schafer subsequently collected the findings from the world soundscape project and fleshed out the soundscape concept in more detail in his seminal work about the sound environment, \"Tuning of the World\".[10] Schafer has also used the concept in music education.[11] One of Soundscape's co founders is Nezar Kadhem.[12] In music, soundscape compositions are often a form of electronic music or electroacoustic music. Composers who use soundscapes include real-time granular synthesis pioneer Barry Truax, Hildegard Westerkamp, and Luc Ferrari, whose Presque rien, numéro 1 (1970) is an early soundscape composition.[7][13] Soundscape composer Petri Kuljuntausta has created soundscape compositions from the sounds of sky dome and Aurora Borealis and deep sea underwater recordings, and a work entitled \"Charm of Sound\" to be performed at the extreme environment of Saturn's moon Titan. The work landed on the ground of Titan in 2005 after traveling inside the spacecraft Huygens over seven years and four billion kilometers through space. Irv Teibel's Environments series (1969–79) consisted of 30-minute, uninterrupted environmental soundscapes and synthesized or processed versions of natural sound.[14] Music soundscapes can also be generated by automated software methods, such as the experimental TAPESTREA application, a framework for sound design and soundscape composition, and others.[15][16] The soundscape is often the subject of mimicry in timbre-centered music such as Tuvan throat singing. The process of Timbral Listening is used to interpret the timbre of the soundscape. This timbre is mimicked and reproduced using the voice or rich harmonic producing instruments.[17] In Schafer's analysis, there are two distinct soundscapes, \"hi-fi\" and \"lo-fi\", created by the environment. A hi-fi system possesses a positive signal-to-noise ratio.[18] These settings make it possible for discrete sounds to be heard clearly since there is no background noise to obstruct even the smallest disturbance. A rural landscape offers more hi-fi frequencies than a city because the natural landscape creates an opportunity to hear incidences from near and afar. In a lo-fi soundscape, signals are obscured by too many sounds, and perspective is lost within the broad-band of noises.[18] In lo-fi soundscapes everything is very close and compact. A person can only listen to immediate encounters; in most cases even ordinary sounds have to be exuberantly amplified in order to be heard. All sounds are unique in nature. They occur at one time in one place and cannot be replicated. In fact, it is physically impossible for nature to reproduce any phoneme twice in exactly the same manner.[18] According to Schafer there are three main elements of the soundscape: The elements have been further defined as to essential sources: Bernie Krause, naturalist and soundscape ecologist, redefined the sources of sound in terms of their three main components: geophony, biophony, and anthropophony.[20][21][22] Research has traditionally focused mostly on the negative effects of sound on human beings, as in exposure to environmental noise. Noise has been shown to correlate with health-related problems like stress, reduced sleep and cardiovascular disease.[23] More recently however, it has also been shown that some sounds, like sounds of nature and music, can have positive effects on health,[24][25][26][27][28] some of which might be explained by natural sounds increasing cognitive restoration and feelings of calm, for example.[29] While the negative effects of sound has been widely acknowledged by organizations like EU (END 2002/49) and WHO (Burden of noise disease), the", "<2-hop>\n\npositive effects have as yet received less attention. The positive effects of nature sounds can be acknowledged in everyday planning of urban and rural environments, as well as in specific health treatment situations, like nature-based sound therapy[26] and nature-based rehabilitation.[28] Soundscapes from a computerized acoustic device with a camera may also offer synthetic vision to the blind, utilizing human echolocation, as is the goal of the seeing with sound project.[30] Papers on noise pollution are increasingly taking a holistic, soundscape approach to noise control. Whereas acoustics tends to rely on lab measurements and individual acoustic characteristics of cars and so on, soundscape takes a top-down approach. Drawing on John Cage's ideas of the whole world as composition,[citation needed] soundscape researchers investigate people's attitudes to soundscapes as a whole rather than individual aspects – and look at how the entire environment can be changed to be more pleasing to the ear. This body of knowledge approaches the sonic environment subjectively as well, as in how some sounds are tolerated while others disdained, with still others preferred, as seen in Fong's 2016 research comparing the soundscapes of Bangkok, Thailand and Los Angeles, California.[31] To respond to unwanted sounds, however, a typical application of this is the use of masking strategies, as in the use of water features to cover unwanted white noise from traffic. It has been shown that masking can work in some cases, but that the successful outcome is dependent on several factors, like sound pressure levels, orientation of the sources, and character of the water sound.[32][33] Research has shown that variation is an important factor to consider, as a varied soundscape give people the possibility to seek out their favorite environment depending on preference, mood and other factors.[32] One way to ensure variation is to work with \"quiet areas\" in urban situations. It has been suggested that people's opportunity to access quiet, natural places in urban areas can be enhanced by improving the ecological quality of urban green spaces through targeted planning and design and that in turn has psychological benefits.[34] Soundscaping as a method to reduce noise pollution incorporates natural elements rather than just man made elements.[35] Soundscapes can be designed by urban planners and landscape architects. By incorporating knowledge of soundscapes in their work, certain sounds can be enhanced, while others can be reduced or controlled.[36] It has been argued that there are three main ways in which soundscapes can be designed: localization of functions, reduction of unwanted sounds and introduction of wanted sounds,[32] each of which should be considered to ensure a comprehensive approach to soundscape design. The National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division[37] actively protects the soundscapes and acoustic environments in national parks across the country. Acoustic resources are physical sound sources, including both natural sounds (wind, water, wildlife, vegetation) and cultural and historic sounds (battle reenactments, tribal ceremonies, quiet reverence). The acoustic environment is the combination of all the acoustic resources within a given area – natural sounds and human-caused sounds – as modified by the environment. The acoustic environment includes sound vibrations made by geological processes, biological activity, and even sounds that are inaudible to most humans, such as bat echolocation calls. Soundscape is the component of the acoustic environment that can be perceived and comprehended by the humans. The character and quality of the soundscape influence human perceptions of an area, providing a sense of place that differentiates it from other regions. Noise refers to sound which is unwanted, either because of its effects on humans and wildlife, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. Cultural soundscapes include opportunities for appropriate transmission of cultural and historic sounds that are fundamental components of the purposes and values for which the parks were established."], "reference": "Urban planning and soundscape design can be used to mitigate noise pollution by incorporating natural elements and focusing on three main strategies: localization of functions, reduction of unwanted sounds, and introduction of wanted sounds.

Noise has been shown to correlate with health-related problems like stress, reduced sleep and cardiovascular disease.[23] More recently however, it has also been shown that some sounds, like sounds of nature and music, can have positive effects on health,[24][25][26][27][28] some of which might be explained by natural sounds increasing cognitive restoration and feelings of calm, for example.[29] While the negative effects of sound has been widely acknowledged by organizations like EU (END 2002/49) and WHO (Burden of noise disease), the", "<2-hop>\n\npositive effects have as yet received less attention. The positive effects of nature sounds can be acknowledged in everyday planning of urban and rural environments, as well as in specific health treatment situations, like nature-based sound therapy[26] and nature-based rehabilitation.[28] Soundscapes from a computerized acoustic device with a camera may also offer synthetic vision to the blind, utilizing human echolocation, as is the goal of the seeing with sound project.[30] Papers on noise pollution are increasingly taking a holistic, soundscape approach to noise control. Whereas acoustics tends to rely on lab measurements and individual acoustic characteristics of cars and so on, soundscape takes a top-down approach. Drawing on John Cage's ideas of the whole world as composition,[citation needed] soundscape researchers investigate people's attitudes to soundscapes as a whole rather than individual aspects – and look at how the entire environment can be changed to be more pleasing to the ear. This body of knowledge approaches the sonic environment subjectively as well, as in how some sounds are tolerated while others disdained, with still others preferred, as seen in Fong's 2016 research comparing the soundscapes of Bangkok, Thailand and Los Angeles, California.[31] To respond to unwanted sounds, however, a typical application of this is the use of masking strategies, as in the use of water features to cover unwanted white noise from traffic. It has been shown that masking can work in some cases, but that the successful outcome is dependent on several factors, like sound pressure levels, orientation of the sources, and character of the water sound.[32][33] Research has shown that variation is an important factor to consider, as a varied soundscape give people the possibility to seek out their favorite environment depending on preference, mood and other factors.[32] One way to ensure variation is to work with \"quiet areas\" in urban situations. It has been suggested that people's opportunity to access quiet, natural places in urban areas can be enhanced by improving the ecological quality of urban green spaces through targeted planning and design and that in turn has psychological benefits.[34] Soundscaping as a method to reduce noise pollution incorporates natural elements rather than just man made elements.[35] Soundscapes can be designed by urban planners and landscape architects. By incorporating knowledge of soundscapes in their work, certain sounds can be enhanced, while others can be reduced or controlled.[36] It has been argued that there are three main ways in which soundscapes can be designed: localization of functions, reduction of unwanted sounds and introduction of wanted sounds,[32] each of which should be considered to ensure a comprehensive approach to soundscape design. The National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division[37] actively protects the soundscapes and acoustic environments in national parks across the country. Acoustic resources are physical sound sources, including both natural sounds (wind, water, wildlife, vegetation) and cultural and historic sounds (battle reenactments, tribal ceremonies, quiet reverence). The acoustic environment is the combination of all the acoustic resources within a given area – natural sounds and human-caused sounds – as modified by the environment. The acoustic environment includes sound vibrations made by geological processes, biological activity, and even sounds that are inaudible to most humans, such as bat echolocation calls. Soundscape is the component of the acoustic environment that can be perceived and comprehended by the humans. The character and quality of the soundscape influence human perceptions of an area, providing a sense of place that differentiates it from other regions.

Several artists principally identified as rock, such as the Eagles and America, scored significant pop chart hits with country rock songs, though they may have reached country charts rarely or not at all.[11][12] Glen Campbell's \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" was a crossover hit between the pop and country charts in 1975.[13] \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" was produced by blue-eyed soul writer team Dennis Lambert & Brian Potter and written by Larry Weiss. The Bellamy Brothers' \"Let Your Love Flow\", Amazing Rhythm Aces' \"Third Rate Romance\" (1976), Glen Campbell's Southern Nights (1977), and Anne Murray's \"You Needed Me\" (1978) were additional examples of late '70s pop country hits. In 1977, Kenny Rogers, former frontman of the rock band the First Edition, burst onto the country charts with \"Lucille\" and would go on to rank among the most successful country pop performers.[14] After \"Lucille\", Rogers had a string of songs that did well on both the country and pop charts around the world, including \"Daytime Friends\", \"The Gambler\", and \"Coward of the County\", all of which were produced by Larry Butler. Rogers would go on to push the boundaries of pop influence in country music, having records produced by the likes of the Bee Gees, Lionel Richie, David Foster, and George Martin, all of which did well in both the pop and country markets. Barbara Mandrell also became known for her blue-eyed soul vocal style. Several of her other hits charted on the country adult contemporary charts, but her songs were the Bubbling under Billboard Top 100 charts. She was one of country music's most successful artists during the 1970s and 1980s. She was involved in a serious car accident in 1984.[15] Her big country hits included \"Sleeping Single In a Double Bed\" and \"(If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right.\" In 1977, Dolly Parton crossed over into the pop music world with her No. 1 country and No. 3 pop hit \"Here You Come Again.\"[16] Parton earned another big hit with \"9 to 5\", which topped both the country and pop singles charts in early 1981, supplemented by the 1980 film of the same name. Country pop reached new heights immediately following the movie Urban Cowboy in the early 1980s. Urban Cowboy was the third music-themed hit film to star John Travolta, each from a different genre; much like Saturday Night Fever did for disco and Grease did for oldies, Urban Cowboy popularized pop-country, helping to boost the career of Mickey Gilley in particular (whose real-life bar and music were featured in the film), along with other songs that appeared on the film's soundtrack.[17] Willie Nelson and Dottie West came back in the 1980s. Dottie West released a series of hit duets with Kenny Rogers. Kenny Rogers also had a duet hit with Parton, the Bee Gees–penned \"Islands in the Stream\", which topped the country and pop singles charts in late 1983. (The Bee Gees themselves have one credited country hit to their name, 1978's \"Rest Your Love on Me\", which was made an even bigger hit by Conway Twitty in 1980.) Dottie West achieved her biggest success as a country singer during this time, acquiring her first No. 1 hit as a solo artist in 1980 with \"A Lesson in Leaving\". Oak Ridge Boys, Alabama, Eddie Rabbitt, Juice Newton, Bertie Higgins, and Ronnie Milsap also had crossover success during the early 1980s. The Oak Ridge Boys had a crossover hit \"Elvira\" in 1981. Four of Alabama's most successful songs of the early 1980s—\"Feels So Right\", \"Love in the First Degree\", Take Me Down\", and \"The Closer You Get\" (the last two of which were covers of songs by then–pop band Exile)—all reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, while four of Ronnie Milsap's No. 1 songs between 1980 and 1982 reached the Hot 100s Top 20, the most successful of which was the No. 5 hit \"(There's) No Gettin' Over Me\". Rabbitt had three top-5 pop songs in 1980–1981, and \"I Love a Rainy Night\" reached No. 1 on both the Hot 100 and Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Country star Juice Newton also achieved country-pop success with several crossover hits in the early '80s, including \"Queen of Hearts\", \"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\", and Grammy-winner \"Break It To Me Gently\"; in addition, she wrote \"Sweet Sweet Smile\", the only country hit for easy-listening act the Carpenters. Former pop acts such as Exile, Marie Osmond, Bill Medley (formerly of the Righteous Brothers), Tom Jones, Michael Johnson, Billy Joe Royal, B. J. Thomas, Nicolette Larson, Paul Davis and Dan Seals (\"England Dan\" of England Dan and John Ford Coley) began targeting their music at the country market in the early 1980s with a country-pop sound. Although a number of country pop artists continued to have hits, most notably Alabama, Parton, Mandrell, Rabbitt, and Milsap, the mid-1980s saw a major sea change within the country music industry and the revival of traditional country sounds, as the boost in country's crossover popularity had collapsed; by 1984, country record sales had fallen to the point they were before Urban Cowboy was released.[18] Country pop enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s, primarily because of the beginning proliferation of country music to the FM radio dial, which in turn was aided by the increase of FCC licenses for suburban and rural FM stations in the late 1980s and an increase in talk radio on the AM dial, as well as a decision by Billboard to no longer count record sales toward the country singles chart, giving country radio full power to determine a chart ranking by their collective airplay.

Radio airplay is still physically reported by the Texas Regional Radio Report. Many of Texas country artists maintain a yearly membership with the Texas Country Music Association, a community of touring and recording artists, songwriters, and many other contributors to the Texas music industry.[35] Royal Caribbean International and Luxx Vacations have partnered with various sponsors to host a Texas Country Music Cruise on the Liberty of the Seas, featuring many Texas music artists such as Cory Morrow, William Clark Green, and Bri Bagwell.[36]", "<2-hop>\n\nTexas country music (more popularly known just as Texas country or Texas music) is a subgenre of country music from Texas. Texas country is a style of Western music and is often associated with other distinct neighboring styles,[1] including Red Dirt from Oklahoma,[2] the New Mexico music of New Mexico,[3] and Tejano in Texas,[4] all of which have influenced one another over the years, and are popular throughout Texas, the Midwest, the Southwest, and other parts of the Western United States. Texas Country is known for fusing neotraditional country with the outspoken, care-free views of outlaw country. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a \"common working man\" theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound. Neither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas-based. For example, Chris Knight is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his Kentucky ties. Adam Hood, an Alabama native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as Alberta, Canada native Corb Lund, have been successful in the Texas Country scene. The acoustic guitar is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of electric guitars, steel guitars or pedal steel guitars in the genre is not uncommon. Bass and percussion are used in live performances. The sounds of piano, baritone guitar, banjo, accordion, fiddle or harmonica on studio recordings are the norm for the genre. The line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas music charts.[5] The live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene. Enthusiasm is the best descriptor for both band and crowd at a live Texas Country performance. \"It is not an uncommon sight to see clubs all over Texas packed to the rafters; girls and boys in cowboy hats and Wranglers two-stepping next to the mosh pit, where college boys or \"Man Fans\" in khakis and college girls pressed up against the stage\".[6] An important factor Texas Country's success is in the frequency of live performances. It is not uncommon for a Texas Country band to tour 200+ dates a year, all, or nearly all, in the State of Texas[citation needed]. This allows the fan to attend a band's show more often, thus interacting with the music on a more personal level. Popular venues include, Gruene Hall (Gruene), Billy Bob's (Ft. Worth), Cowboys Red River[7] (Dallas and San Antonio), John T. Floore's Country Store[8] (Helotes), Luckenbach Dance Hall (near Fredericksburg), and Blue Light Live[9] (Lubbock). In addition to local and state wide venues hosting live performances, the Texas Regional Radio Report hosts the annual Texas Regional Radio Music Awards Show where the Texas Red Dirt artist and radio stations are recognized for the outstanding achievements throughout the year. The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show. The voting membership has grown to over 32,000 voting members in five years and continues to expand every year.

{"user_input": "How did Texas country start, and who some early Texas Country artists was?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country music. Legendary Country Music Outlaw Willie Nelson was inspired by his friend Waylon Jennings, a country legend and inspiration to present Texas country musicians himself, when he said “Your melody goes where the words take you”.[10] There are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These themes include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), \"It's Not Working Out\" (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).[11] Songs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs. The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs. Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme. The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well. \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".[12] Country music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country music through the world and the state’s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country music.[13]", "<2-hop>\n\nTexas Country's roots lie in the Outlaw country movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Texan artists such as George Strait, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, David Allan Coe retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to Austin, Luckenbach, and Houston. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff Walker, Gary P. Nunn, Steve Young, Kris Kristofferson, Joe Ely, Terry Allen, Steve Earle, and Townes Van Zandt. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts[citation needed]. These artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as Robert Earl Keen, Lyle Lovett, Wayne Hancock,Kevin Fowler, Roger Creager, Pat Green, Cory Morrow, Radney Foster, Max Stalling, Wade Bowen George Ducas, Randy Rogers, & Rich O’Toole. While the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as Jason Boland, Stoney LaRue, Mike McClure, and Cross Canadian Ragweed have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states. George Strait has the most songs about Texas. “Amarillo by Morning” and “All My Exes Live In Texas” are his most popular Texas songs. Robert Earl Keen's No. 2 Live Dinner, released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".[14] Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable. His 1996 live album release truly showcased the “wide range” of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. Joe Ely and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of “The Road Goes On Forever”. Cory Morrow, a Houston native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album Outside the Lines, Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.[15][citation needed] Pat Green, also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album Wave on Wave after switching to a \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music. The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart and won a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. Kevin Fowler, a former hair-metal/glam rocker was Dangerous Toys guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from Amarillo, he self-released his country debut album One For The Road in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, Beer, Bait, and Ammo. He has since found national success, on a major label. Texas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as Jack Ingram, who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a CMT Music Award in 2007 and the 2008 Academy of Country Music award for New Male Vocalist of the Year. He has also scored top 25 singles on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"Love You\" and his cover of Hinder's \"Lips of an Angel\".

Despite placing at the top of Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, Kacey Musgraves's album Star-Crossed was deemed ineligible for nomination in the Best Country Album category for the 64th Grammys, owing to the policy that potential nominated albums must contain at least \"51 percent of new country recordings\".[47] Billboard, however, pointed out that Musgraves was hardly the first to face controversy from the Grammys; previous records nominated in Pop categories included Dolly Parton's \"Here You Come Again\" and \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" by Glen Campbell.[48] Musgraves did, however, earn two nominations for Best Country Song and Best Country Performance for the album track, \"Camera Roll.\"[49] In 2023, three pop country songs placed within the first four spots on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 for the first time in the chart's 65-year history.[50] Billboard noted the overall increase in the popularity of pop country and credited Morgan Wallen with 40 percent of its growth, calling the phenomenon the \"Wallen Effect\".[51] The popularity of pop country continues to surge, with a 2023 Economist poll finding it has become more popular than hip hop in the United States.[52]", "<2-hop>\n\nwas a significant shift away from big-voiced power ballads to more casual, hip-hop influenced styles. One such trend was the controversial bro-country subgenre, which Vulture described as \"music by and of the tatted, gym-toned, party-hearty young American white dude.\"[20] During this decade, Uncle Kracker achieved success when his number 3 adult contemporary hit \"Smile\" also became a number 6 country hit. Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson hit number 3 on adult contemporary, 9 on adult pop and 1 on country charts with the song \"Don't You Wanna Stay\". Other records to hit on both the pop and country charts included Miley Cyrus' \"The Climb\", Lady A's \"Just A Kiss\", the Band Perry's \"If I Die Young\", Kelly Clarkson's \"Mr. Know It All\", Hunter Hayes' \"Wanted\", and Florida Georgia Line's \"Cruise\". Sam Hunt also earned significant crossover appeal. His 2014 debut album Montevallo, which featured hip-hop and rap influences, reached number 1 on Top Country Albums and number 3 on the Billboard 200. His 2017 single \"Body Like a Back Road\" reached number 1 on Hot Country Songs, number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 11 on Adult Top 40. Hip hop's penchant for story-telling is one of the reasons frequently cited for its influence on mainstream pop country.[21] Additionally, there are now no less than four generations who have grown up listening to both country music and hip hop, as evidenced in the subgenre country rap, starting with Jelly Roll, Colt Ford, Cowboy Troy, and Kid Rock. In 2016, Morgan Wallen signed to Big Loud, releasing his debut album, If I Know Me in 2018, with strong hip-hop elements like trap beats and snap tracks.[22] If I Know Me included the singles \"Up Down\" (featuring Florida Georgia Line), \"Whiskey Glasses\", and \"Chasin' You\"; the album reached number 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.[23] Wallen's second album, Dangerous: The Double Album, was released in January 2021, and in February 2021, became the only country album in the 64-year history of the Billboard 200 to spend its first seven weeks at No. 1.[24] It spent a total of ten weeks at that spot, the first album to do so since Whitney Houston's Whitney in 1987.[25] The album included Billboard No. 1 singles \"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", and \"Wasted on You\".[26] In 2018, many country artists achieved international pop hit singles in collaborations with mainstream pop artists. This included Chris Stapleton who collaborated with Justin Timberlake on Hot 100 top ten single \"Say Something\"; Urban-pop star Bebe Rexha whose duet with the country duo Florida Georgia Line \"Meant to Be\" reached No. 2 both in Australia and in the U.S.; and German DJ Zedd whose dance hit \"The Middle\" featured main vocals from Maren Morris and peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] Of particular note, in 2012, Billboard restored recording sales to the chart formula but also added airplay from non-country stations, giving an inherent advantage to country pop crossover songs, at the same time maintaining the 1990 formula solely to measure country radio airplay. After the change, crossover songs have increasingly set the record for the longest run atop the country chart for longer and longer stretches; \"Meant to Be\" currently holds the record, 50 weeks and counting as of November 2018, more than double the pre-2012 record (Leroy Van Dyke's \"Walk On By\" was atop the chart for 19 weeks in 1963, during the 1958–1990 period of a unified sales, jukebox and airplay chart; three songs topped the various separate country charts for 21 weeks each between 1948 and 1955). The way audiences consumed their music also changed during the 2010s, as streaming services became more prominent, thus affecting how artists marketed their songs.[28] Being played on the radio was no longer a requirement to be a contender in the country industry, as it had been for decades before; one such example was Kacey Musgraves. Despite receiving little airplay for her singles sent to country radio, Musgraves won the Grammy award for Album of the Year in 2019, for her fourth studio album Golden Hour.[29] Musgraves's success was unprecedented in the sense that she earned fans from both the pop and country genres without the benefit of airplay on country radio, instead promoting her music through online media platforms such as YouTube and Apple Music.[30][31] The Hoya pointed out Musgraves's groundbreaking approach, writing, \"Musgraves's refusal to bend the knee for Nashville record label executives, coupled with her massive success, proves she is the Nashville big machine's worst nightmare. She is a female artist who managed to find widespread success in an industry that endlessly tried to muzzle her.\"[32] The disparity between male and female artists on country radio became even more obvious during the back half of this decade, with one study finding that male artists accounted for 5.5 to 1 in total airplay during the years 2000–2018.[33] In 2018, that number only increased, with a ratio of male vs. female at 9.7 to 1.[33] In 2015, radio consultant Keith Hill made controversial comments about why women received less representation on the radio, referring to male artists as the \"salad\" and women as \"tomatoes\"; the controversy became known as Tomato-gate.[34] Collaborations between country and pop artists became even more popularized during this decade, as well. In October 2019, country duo Dan + Shay released a joint single with pop singer-songwriter Justin Bieber, \"10,000 Hours\", which went to number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts.[35] In April 2020, country singer-songwriter Kelsea Ballerini released \"The Other Girl\" as a joint single with pop singer Halsey from her third studio album kelsea. The single peaked within the top twenty of both the Hot Country Songs and U.S. Adult Top 40 charts. At the February 2020 Country Radio Seminar, there was discussion on the increase in fan attention to pop and country collaborations, in addition to an increase in the use of streaming services.[36] In 2020, American Idol finalist Gabby"], "reference": "Sam Hunt was influential in shifting mainstream attitudes about country music's more pop-inflected sound. He possessed fluency in the postures and cadences of millennial pop that turned heads and blurred boundaries. His borrowings are softer and sneakier, incorporating hip-hop influences into his music.

{"user_input": "Given that lyrical content is the backbone of Texas country music, what are some common themes explored by Texas country artists, and how do these themes reflect the genre's connection to Texas?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country music. Legendary Country Music Outlaw Willie Nelson was inspired by his friend Waylon Jennings, a country legend and inspiration to present Texas country musicians himself, when he said “Your melody goes where the words take you”.[10] There are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These themes include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), \"It's Not Working Out\" (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).[11] Songs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs. The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs. Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme. The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well. \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".[12] Country music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country music through the world and the state’s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country music.[13]", "<2-hop>\n\nTexas country music (more popularly known just as Texas country or Texas music) is a subgenre of country music from Texas. Texas country is a style of Western music and is often associated with other distinct neighboring styles,[1] including Red Dirt from Oklahoma,[2] the New Mexico music of New Mexico,[3] and Tejano in Texas,[4] all of which have influenced one another over the years, and are popular throughout Texas, the Midwest, the Southwest, and other parts of the Western United States. Texas Country is known for fusing neotraditional country with the outspoken, care-free views of outlaw country. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a \"common working man\" theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound. Neither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas-based. For example, Chris Knight is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his Kentucky ties. Adam Hood, an Alabama native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as Alberta, Canada native Corb Lund, have been successful in the Texas Country scene. The acoustic guitar is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of electric guitars, steel guitars or pedal steel guitars in the genre is not uncommon. Bass and percussion are used in live performances. The sounds of piano, baritone guitar, banjo, accordion, fiddle or harmonica on studio recordings are the norm for the genre. The line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas music charts.[5] The live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene. Enthusiasm is the best descriptor for both band and crowd at a live Texas Country performance. \"It is not an uncommon sight to see clubs all over Texas packed to the rafters; girls and boys in cowboy hats and Wranglers two-stepping next to the mosh pit, where college boys or \"Man Fans\" in khakis and college girls pressed up against the stage\".[6] An important factor Texas Country's success is in the frequency of live performances. It is not uncommon for a Texas Country band to tour 200+ dates a year, all, or nearly all, in the State of Texas[citation needed]. This allows the fan to attend a band's show more often, thus interacting with the music on a more personal level. Popular venues include, Gruene Hall (Gruene), Billy Bob's (Ft. Worth), Cowboys Red River[7] (Dallas and San Antonio), John T. Floore's Country Store[8] (Helotes), Luckenbach Dance Hall (near Fredericksburg), and Blue Light Live[9] (Lubbock). In addition to local and state wide venues hosting live performances, the Texas Regional Radio Report hosts the annual Texas Regional Radio Music Awards Show where the Texas Red Dirt artist and radio stations are recognized for the outstanding achievements throughout the year. The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show. The voting membership has grown to over 32,000 voting members in five years and continues to expand every year. The awards show is open to the public and fans alike who cheer on their favorite artist/entertainers and radio stations.
