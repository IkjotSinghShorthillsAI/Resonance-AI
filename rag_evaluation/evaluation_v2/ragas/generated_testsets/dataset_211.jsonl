The use of drums from the Roland TR-808, sustained kick drum, heavy bass, raised dance tempos, and frequently sexually explicit lyrical content differentiate it from other hip hop subgenres. Music author Richie Unterberger has characterized Miami bass as using rhythms with a \"stop-start flavor\" and \"hissy\" cymbals with lyrics that \"reflected the language of the streets, particularly Miami's historically black neighborhoods such as Liberty City, Goulds, and Overtown\".[1] Despite Miami bass never having consistent mainstream acceptance, early national media attention in the 1980s resulted in a profound impact on the development of hip hop, dance music, and pop.[2] During the 1980s, the focus of Miami bass tended to be on DJs and record producers, rather than individual performers. Record labels such as Pandisc, HOT Records, 4-Sight Records and Skyywalker Records released much material of the genre. Unterberger has referred to James (Maggotron) McCauley (also known as DXJ, Maggozulu Too, Planet Detroit and Bass Master Khan) as the \"father of Miami bass\", a distinction McCauley denies, choosing to confer that status on producer Amos Larkins.[3][2] DJ Kurtis Mantronik (Mantronix) was a key influence on Miami bass. In particular, Mantronik's single \"Bass Machine\" (1986), featuring rap vocals by T La Rock, was pivotal to the development of Miami bass.[4] MC ADE's \"Bass Rock Express\", with music and beats produced by Amos Larkins, is often credited as being the first Miami bass record to gain underground popularity on an international scale.[2] The single \"Throw The D\" by the group 2 Live Crew in 1986 gave a permanent blueprint to how future Miami bass songs were written and produced.[2] 2 Live Crew (Christopher Wong \"Fresh Kid Ice\" Won, Luther \"Luke Skyywalker\" Campbell and David \"Mr. Mixx\" Hobbs) played a key role in popularizing Miami bass in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group's 1986 release, The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are, became controversial for its sexually explicit lyrics. 1989's As Nasty As They Wanna Be, along with its hit single \"Me So Horny\", proved more controversial still, leading to legal troubles for both 2 Live Crew and retailers selling the album. All charges were eventually overturned on appeal.[2] For the better part of the mid-'80s and early '90s, DJs such as Luke Skyywalker's Ghetto Style DJs, Norberto Morales' Triple M DJs, Super JD's MHF DJs, Space Funk DJs, Mohamed Moretta, DJ Nice & Nasty, Felix Sama, DJ Spin, Ramon Hernandez, Bass Master DJs, DJ Laz, Earl \"The Pearl\" Little, Uncle Al, Ser MC, Raylo & Dem Damn Dogs, DJ Slice, K-Bass, Jam Pony Express and others were heavily involved in playing Miami bass at local outdoor events to large audiences at area beaches, parks, and fairs. Clubs in South Florida, including Pac-Jam, Superstars Rollertheque, Bass Station, Studio 183, Randolphs, Nepenthe, Video Powerhouse, Skylight Express, Beat Club and Club Boca, were hosting bass nights on a regular basis. Miami radio airplay and programming support was strong in the now defunct Rhythm 98, as well as WEDR and WPOW (Power 96). Contribution and promotion of Miami bass also came out of Orlando. 102 Jamz (WJHM), a prominent Orlando radio station in the late '80s, featured Miami bass and helped its popularity rise in and around Central Florida. Florida breaks was heavily influenced by Miami bass in addition to elements of house, and deep bass that eventually created \"The Orlando Sound\". Thus, Miami bass quickly became a Florida staple. By the mid-1990s, the influence of Miami bass had spread outside South and Central Florida to all areas of Florida and the Southern United States. In the mid-1990s, it saw a commercial and mainstream resurgence, with Miami bass influenced artists such as L'Trimm, 95 South, Tag Team, 69 Boyz, Quad City DJ's and Freak Nasty all scoring big Miami bass hits. Examples of these songs are \"Whoomp! (There It Is)\" by Tag Team in 1993,[5] \"Tootsee Roll\" by 69 Boyz in 1994,[6] \"C'mon N' Ride It (The Train)\" by the Quad City DJ's in 1996[7] and \"Whoot, There It Is\" by 95 South in 1993.[5] These songs all reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and exposed Miami bass nationally. These artists generally used a Miami bass sound and production but did it in a far less explicit and far more accessible way than had been previously done by Campbell and the 2 Live Crew.[8] Miami bass is closely related to the electronic dance music genres of ghettotech and booty house, genres which combine Detroit techno and Chicago house with the Miami bass sound. Ghettotech follows the same sexually oriented lyrics, hip-hop bass lines and streetwise attitude, but with harder, uptempo Roland TR-909 techno-style kick beats. In 2007, contemporary hip-hop and R&B songs became more dance oriented, showing influences of Miami bass and techno, and are typically sped up to a \"chipmunk\" sound for faster tempos for dances such as juking, wu-tanging and bopping, usually only done in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties in south Florida.[citation needed] Miami bass has been influenced by the cultural history of its wide-ranging community with the evolution of Cuban, Dominican, and Afro-Brazilian-fused sub-genres that include Baltimore club and funk carioca.[9][10] Another subgenre of Miami bass is \"car audio bass\", which features an even more stripped down bass-heavy sound, tending to focus on either extremely hard 909 kicks combined with sine waves or the classic 808 kick, or sometimes simply the sine wave by itself.[citation needed] Some artist examples would be DJ Laz, DJ Magic Mike, Afro-Rican (as Power Supply), Techmaster P.E.B., DJ Billy E, Bass 305 and Bass Patrol.

UK drill developed a different production style than the most common Chicago beat patterns, albeit still based on Chicago drill styles originally pioneered by DJ L, a Chicago producer who collaborated with rapper G Herbo in the early Chicago scene.[9] The genre also took influence from earlier British genres such as grime and UK garage; in an interview with Complex, Jammer noted that \"without grime...there would be no UK drill.\"[10] Drill producer Mazza noted that both drill and grime share a similar rawness and energy, despite the two genres remaining distinct from each other. Drill producer Carns Hill, alongside several drill rappers, noted that UK drill should probably have a \"new name\" to distinguish it from the original Chicago drill sound.[11][12] UK drill is generally more fast-paced compared to its Chicago counterpart. UK drill beats are generally structured around an contrast to the typical trap/Chicago drill beat, the hi-hats have moved from on-beat and triplet subdivisions to a steady 3+3+2 polyrhythm, hi-hat pattern, with snares landing on the fourth beat instead of the third every 2 bars. Instrumentals often also have a sliding bass, hard hitting kicks, and dark melodies. AXL Beats explained that the 808s and fast-tempo snares in UK drill are derivative of grime music.[13][14] Both genres typically use a tempo of approximately 138–151 beats per minute.[15][16] Censorship of UK drill lyrics through vocal cuts and mutes is sometimes done to avoid them being used during their prosecution by the police;[17] for example, \"shh\" is used in songs to replace the names of people, weapons and criminal acts.[18] 150 (now known as GBG), a group from the Angell Town Estate in Brixton, is often credited with pioneering UK drill music, with 150 members Stickz, M Dargg and Grizzy (stylized as GR1ZZY) being dedicated exponents of the early style. 67 is often credited for shifting the sound away from the Chicago influences it seemed to heavily draw inspiration from in its early days and foundation and for forming a more homegrown sound.[19] Producers Carns Hill (who crafted instrumentals for many of 67's early songs) and QUIETPVCK (who worked closely by 150 and 410 members in their early era) are widely considered to be two of the main pioneering producers of the genre with their unique and innovative alternatives to the Chicago drill sound.[19][20] An article from VICE divided the history of UK drill into 3 phases; the first of these phases, which lasted from 2014 to 2018, resulted in drill becoming \"its own distinctly British entity\", with the phase peaking in 2016 following the release of \"Let's Lurk\" by 67, featuring Giggs. Given that the genre was \"locked out\" of the mainstream music industry due to its uncensored nature, music videos became a major player in the genre's circulation.[21] Its uncensored nature also resulted in Form 696 being used to cancel shows by drill artists.[22] In early 2017, \"Kennington Where It Started\" was released by the Harlem Spartans, considered by fans to have turned UK drill from an underground genre into a mainstream one.[23] In 2018, members of 1011 (now known as CGM), including Digga D, were given a court order that banned them from making music without police permission; in addition, they couldn't mention death or injury, including the death of Abdullahi Tarabi, and had to notify police in advance of any song releases or performances. Kevin Southworth, Detective Chief Superintendent, noted that it was \"one of the first times\" that such an order was made. The order was condemned by Index on Censorship.[24] In 2019, Skengdo & AM, members of drill group 410, were handed a 9-month suspended sentence, suspended for 2 years, for breaching a gang injunction.[25] According to The Guardian, the injunction, which lasted until January 2021, prevented Skengdo & AM, as well as 2 other members of 410, from entering the SE11 postcode, as well as prohibiting them from performing songs that had lyrics mentioning rival crews, their rappers or any mentions to them entering the territory of other groups.[26] The sentence resulted in a letter being signed by 65 people that was addressed to the Metropolitan Police, calling upon them to stop issuing gang injunctions and stating that musicians should be given the rights of freedom of speech and creative expression.[27]"], "reference": "67 is often credited for shifting the sound of UK drill away from the Chicago influences it seemed to heavily draw inspiration from in its early days and foundation and for forming a more homegrown sound.

They reached number 66 in the Official Albums Chart with the mixtape Let's Lurk and number 71 with the mixtape The Glorious Twelfth.[31] Although considered a predominantly trap-based album that implemented some drill features and elements, Section Boyz's mixtape Don't Panic reached number 37 in the UK Albums Chart, later peaking at number 36 in 2015.[32] Canadian musician Drake did a \"Behind Barz\" freestyle for Link Up TV in 2018, where he rapped over a UK drill beat.

The mixtape scored the biggest opening week for a UK drill album at the time, opening at number 12.[37] The same year, Skengdo & AM released EU Drillas, a collaborative project that featured drill artists from across Europe;[38] in addition, Headie One released \"Only You Freestyle\" with Drake, which peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart.[39] Towards the end of the year, he released Edna, which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart,[40] becoming the first UK drill album to do so.[41] In 2021, Digga D's mixtape Made in the Pyrex peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the highest-charting UK drill mixtape at the time.[42] In the same year, Tion Wayne and Russ Millions released \"Body\", becoming the first UK drill song to reach Number 1 on the UK Singles Chart.[43] Though the genre originated in London, it is not restricted to London alone as the genre's sole production hub in terms of emerging talents and dissemination of the sound. Artists around the country have appeared and become prominent creators within the scene, such as SmuggzyAce and S.White of Birmingham group 23 Drillas and SV of Nottingham.[44][45] UK drill has spread outside of the United Kingdom, with artists and groups in other countries rapping in styles and using slang terms heavily influenced by UK drill music, and using UK drill instrumentals produced by British producers.

{"user_input": "How minimal techno influence EDM, and who is best example of minimal techno in EDM scene?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nMinimal techno is a subgenre of techno music.[1] It is characterized by a stripped-down[2] aesthetic that exploits the use of repetition and understated development. Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell.[3][4] By the early 2000s the term \"minimal\" generally described a style of techno that was popularized in Germany by labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, and Richie Hawtin's M-nus, among others. Minimal techno first emerged in the early 1990s. The development of the style is often attributed to a so-called \"second wave\" of American producers associated with Detroit techno. According to Derrick May, \"while the first-wave artists were enjoying their early global success, techno also inspired many up-and-coming DJs and bedroom producers in Detroit\".[5] This younger generation included producers such as Richie Hawtin, Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, and Mike Banks. The work of several of these artists evolved to become focused on minimalism. Robert Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too \"ravey\", with increasing tempos leading to the emergence of gabber. Such trends saw the demise of the soul-infused techno that typified the original Detroit sound. Robert Hood has noted that he and Daniel Bell both realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave era, and saw that an important feature of the original techno sound had been lost. Hood states that \"it sounded great from a production standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the old structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.\"[4] The minimal techno sound that emerged at this time has been defined by Robert Hood as \"a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. It's a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound.\"[6] Daniel Bell has commented that he had a dislike for minimalism in the artistic sense of the word, finding it too \"arty\".[4] In Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music (2004), music journalist Philip Sherburne states that, like most contemporary electronic dance music, minimal techno has its roots in the landmark works of pioneers such as Kraftwerk and Detroit techno's Derrick May and Juan Atkins. Minimal techno focuses on \"rhythm and repetition instead of melody and linear progression\", much like classical minimalist music and the polyrhythmic African musical tradition that helped to inspire it.[7] By 1994, according to Sherburne, the term \"minimal\" was in use to describe \"any stripped-down, Acidic derivative of classic Detroit style\".[8] Los Angeles-based writer Daniel Chamberlin attributes the origin of minimal techno to the German producers Basic Channel.[9] Chamberlin draws parallels between the productions by Richie Hawtin, Wolfgang Voigt, and Surgeon with phase music techniques used by American minimalist composer Steve Reich. Chamberlin also sees the use of sine tone drones by minimalist composer La Monte Young and the repetitive patterns of \"In C\" by minimalist composer Terry Riley as other influences.[10] Sherburne has suggested that the noted similarities between minimal forms of dance music and American minimalism could easily be accidental. He also notes that much of the music technology used in electronic dance music was traditionally designed to suit loop-based compositional methods, which may explain why certain stylistic features of minimal techno sound similar to those in works by Reich that employ loops and pattern-phasing techniques.[11] Philip Sherburne proposes that minimal techno uses two specific stylistic approaches: skeletalism and massification.[12] According to Sherburne, in skeletal minimal techno, only the core elements are included with embellishments used only for the sake of variation within the song. In contrast, massification is a style of minimalism in which many sounds are layered over time, but with little variation in sonic elements. Today the influence of minimal styles of house music and techno is not only to be found in club music, but is becoming increasingly heard in popular music.[13] Regardless of the style, he writes, \"minimal Techno corkscrews into the very heart of repetition so cerebrally as to often inspire descriptions like 'spartan', 'clinical', 'mathematical', and 'scientific'\".[11] The average tempo of a minimal techno track is between 125 and 130 beats per minute. Richie Hawtin suggests 128 bpm as the perfect tempo.[citation needed] In the early minimal techno scene, most tracks were constructed around a Roland TR-808 or Roland TR-909 drum machine. Both are still often used on today's minimal techno tracks. In contrast to minimal house, minimal techno is less afrocentric and focuses more on middle frequencies rather than deep basses. Many projects in other locations, such as those of Regis in the UK, Basic Channel in Berlin and Mika Vainio in Finland, have also made significant contributions to minimal techno. In recent years, the genre has been heavily influenced by the microhouse genre, to the point of merging with it. It has also fragmented into a great number of difficult to categorize subgenres, equally claimed by the minimal techno and microhouse tags. Minimal techno has found mainstream club popularity since 2004 in such places as Romania,[14] Germany,[15] Portugal, Japan, France, Belgium, South Africa, The Netherlands, Spain, Sri Lanka, Italy, Ireland and the UK, with DJs from a wide variety of genres incorporating differing elements of its tones. In 2003, minimal techno received widespread commercial attention when Kylie Minogue employed the sound on her number-one hit \"Slow\", while in years to come the work of M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade would be sampled by will.i.am.[16] Record labels specializing in minimal techno are [a:rpia:r], Traum Schallplatten, BPitch Control, Cocoon Recordings, Kompakt,[15] Perlon, Clink, Plus8, and Sähkö Recordings, among others.

Minimal techno focuses on \"rhythm and repetition instead of melody and linear progression\", much like classical minimalist music and the polyrhythmic African musical tradition that helped to inspire it.[7] By 1994, according to Sherburne, the term \"minimal\" was in use to describe \"any stripped-down, Acidic derivative of classic Detroit style\".[8] Los Angeles-based writer Daniel Chamberlin attributes the origin of minimal techno to the German producers Basic Channel.[9] Chamberlin draws parallels between the productions by Richie Hawtin, Wolfgang Voigt, and Surgeon with phase music techniques used by American minimalist composer Steve Reich. Chamberlin also sees the use of sine tone drones by minimalist composer La Monte Young and the repetitive patterns of \"In C\" by minimalist composer Terry Riley as other influences.[10] Sherburne has suggested that the noted similarities between minimal forms of dance music and American minimalism could easily be accidental. He also notes that much of the music technology used in electronic dance music was traditionally designed to suit loop-based compositional methods, which may explain why certain stylistic features of minimal techno sound similar to those in works by Reich that employ loops and pattern-phasing techniques.[11] Philip Sherburne proposes that minimal techno uses two specific stylistic approaches: skeletalism and massification.[12] According to Sherburne, in skeletal minimal techno, only the core elements are included with embellishments used only for the sake of variation within the song. In contrast, massification is a style of minimalism in which many sounds are layered over time, but with little variation in sonic elements. Today the influence of minimal styles of house music and techno is not only to be found in club music, but is becoming increasingly heard in popular music.[13] Regardless of the style, he writes, \"minimal Techno corkscrews into the very heart of repetition so cerebrally as to often inspire descriptions like 'spartan', 'clinical', 'mathematical', and 'scientific'\".[11] The average tempo of a minimal techno track is between 125 and 130 beats per minute. Richie Hawtin suggests 128 bpm as the perfect tempo.[citation needed] In the early minimal techno scene, most tracks were constructed around a Roland TR-808 or Roland TR-909 drum machine. Both are still often used on today's minimal techno tracks. In contrast to minimal house, minimal techno is less afrocentric and focuses more on middle frequencies rather than deep basses. Many projects in other locations, such as those of Regis in the UK, Basic Channel in Berlin and Mika Vainio in Finland, have also made significant contributions to minimal techno. In recent years, the genre has been heavily influenced by the microhouse genre, to the point of merging with it. It has also fragmented into a great number of difficult to categorize subgenres, equally claimed by the minimal techno and microhouse tags. Minimal techno has found mainstream club popularity since 2004 in such places as Romania,[14] Germany,[15] Portugal, Japan, France, Belgium, South Africa, The Netherlands, Spain, Sri Lanka, Italy, Ireland and the UK, with DJs from a wide variety of genres incorporating differing elements of its tones. In 2003, minimal techno received widespread commercial attention when Kylie Minogue employed the sound on her number-one hit \"Slow\", while in years to come the work of M.A.N.D.Y. and Booka Shade would be sampled by will.i.am.[16] Record labels specializing in minimal techno are [a:rpia:r], Traum Schallplatten, BPitch Control, Cocoon Recordings, Kompakt,[15] Perlon, Clink, Plus8, and Sähkö Recordings, among others.

Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell.[3][4] By the early 2000s the term \"minimal\" generally described a style of techno that was popularized in Germany by labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, and Richie Hawtin's M-nus, among others. Minimal techno first emerged in the early 1990s. The development of the style is often attributed to a so-called \"second wave\" of American producers associated with Detroit techno. According to Derrick May, \"while the first-wave artists were enjoying their early global success, techno also inspired many up-and-coming DJs and bedroom producers in Detroit\".[5] This younger generation included producers such as Richie Hawtin, Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, and Mike Banks. The work of several of these artists evolved to become focused on minimalism. Robert Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too \"ravey\", with increasing tempos leading to the emergence of gabber. Such trends saw the demise of the soul-infused techno that typified the original Detroit sound. Robert Hood has noted that he and Daniel Bell both realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave era, and saw that an important feature of the original techno sound had been lost. Hood states that \"it sounded great from a production standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the old structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.\"[4] The minimal techno sound that emerged at this time has been defined by Robert Hood as \"a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul.

UK drill developed a different production style than the most common Chicago beat patterns, albeit still based on Chicago drill styles originally pioneered by DJ L, a Chicago producer who collaborated with rapper G Herbo in the early Chicago scene.[9] The genre also took influence from earlier British genres such as grime and UK garage; in an interview with Complex, Jammer noted that \"without grime...there would be no UK drill.\"[10] Drill producer Mazza noted that both drill and grime share a similar rawness and energy, despite the two genres remaining distinct from each other. Drill producer Carns Hill, alongside several drill rappers, noted that UK drill should probably have a \"new name\" to distinguish it from the original Chicago drill sound.[11][12] UK drill is generally more fast-paced compared to its Chicago counterpart. UK drill beats are generally structured around an contrast to the typical trap/Chicago drill beat, the hi-hats have moved from on-beat and triplet subdivisions to a steady 3+3+2 polyrhythm, hi-hat pattern, with snares landing on the fourth beat instead of the third every 2 bars. Instrumentals often also have a sliding bass, hard hitting kicks, and dark melodies. AXL Beats explained that the 808s and fast-tempo snares in UK drill are derivative of grime music.[13][14] Both genres typically use a tempo of approximately 138–151 beats per minute.[15][16] Censorship of UK drill lyrics through vocal cuts and mutes is sometimes done to avoid them being used during their prosecution by the police;[17] for example, \"shh\" is used in songs to replace the names of people, weapons and criminal acts.[18] 150 (now known as GBG), a group from the Angell Town Estate in Brixton, is often credited with pioneering UK drill music, with 150 members Stickz, M Dargg and Grizzy (stylized as GR1ZZY) being dedicated exponents of the early style. 67 is often credited for shifting the sound away from the Chicago influences it seemed to heavily draw inspiration from in its early days and foundation and for forming a more homegrown sound.[19] Producers Carns Hill (who crafted instrumentals for many of 67's early songs) and QUIETPVCK (who worked closely by 150 and 410 members in their early era) are widely considered to be two of the main pioneering producers of the genre with their unique and innovative alternatives to the Chicago drill sound.[19][20] An article from VICE divided the history of UK drill into 3 phases; the first of these phases, which lasted from 2014 to 2018, resulted in drill becoming \"its own distinctly British entity\", with the phase peaking in 2016 following the release of \"Let's Lurk\" by 67, featuring Giggs. Given that the genre was \"locked out\" of the mainstream music industry due to its uncensored nature, music videos became a major player in the genre's circulation.[21] Its uncensored nature also resulted in Form 696 being used to cancel shows by drill artists.[22] In early 2017, \"Kennington Where It Started\" was released by the Harlem Spartans, considered by fans to have turned UK drill from an underground genre into a mainstream one.[23] In 2018, members of 1011 (now known as CGM), including Digga D, were given a court order that banned them from making music without police permission; in addition, they couldn't mention death or injury, including the death of Abdullahi Tarabi, and had to notify police in advance of any song releases or performances. Kevin Southworth, Detective Chief Superintendent, noted that it was \"one of the first times\" that such an order was made. The order was condemned by Index on Censorship.[24] In 2019, Skengdo & AM, members of drill group 410, were handed a 9-month suspended sentence, suspended for 2 years, for breaching a gang injunction.[25] According to The Guardian, the injunction, which lasted until January 2021, prevented Skengdo & AM, as well as 2 other members of 410, from entering the SE11 postcode, as well as prohibiting them from performing songs that had lyrics mentioning rival crews, their rappers or any mentions to them entering the territory of other groups.[26] The sentence resulted in a letter being signed by 65 people that was addressed to the Metropolitan Police, calling upon them to stop issuing gang injunctions and stating that musicians should be given the rights of freedom of speech and creative expression.[27]", "<4-hop>\n\nBrooklyn drill music began rising to prominence in the late 2010s. Brooklyn drill has taken influence from UK drill with artists such as Pop Smoke, Sheff G, and 22Gz collaborating with UK drill producers such as AXL Beats, Yoz Beats, Ghosty, and 808Melo.[52][53][54] 808Melo produced \"Welcome to the Party\" for Pop Smoke, which received a considerable amount of attention. Pop Smoke created a mixtape produced entirely by 808Melo and Trap House Mob (a team of UK-based producers).[55][56] UK drill, alongside grime, has been cited as a reason for the expansion of Multicultural London English to other countries, including Finland[57] and Australia.[58] UK drill groups often engage in rivalries with each other – sometimes violent[59] - often releasing multiple diss tracks towards each other.[60] The names of these groups sometimes reflect the postcode they are located in.[61] Notable rivalries include 67 versus GBG/150,[3][62] Harlem Spartans versus 410,[3][26] Zone 2 versus Moscow17,[3] and CGM/1011 versus 12World.[63] The aesthetic of UK drill videos was described by Jonathan Ilan, of the University of London, in a paper within The British Journal of Criminology; the aesthetic included groups of young men, usually near council houses and wearing a variety of streetwear, using hand gestures to represent a variety of things, including tributes to their friends that were dead or jailed.[64] In addition, as a result of the police response to UK drill, drill artists began to adopt masks to protect their identities; these masks soon became an artistic statement, with an article in Dazed saying that, \"As much as a method of hiding personal information, it was also a way of standing out from the crowd.\"[65] A 2021 book regarding music genres noted that \"rather than personalized nicknames, performers strip themselves of any individuality or character so as to become...conflated with their gang.\"[18] The genre's violent lyrics have been cited by police, MPs, journalists and others in positions of potentially significant influence as the reason for a climb in the rate of knife crimes in London.[7][8] In one instance, then 17-year-old rapper M-Trap who had written lyrics about knife attacks, was part of a four-person group that stabbed a 15-year-old boy to death, for which he received a life sentence.[66] Judge Anthony Leonard QC told Simpson, \"You suggested [the lyrics] were just for show but I do not believe that, and I suspect you were waiting for the right opportunity for an attack.\"[66] In defence of the genre, a 2019 paper in The Sociological Review says that the genre \"naturalistically broadcasts, but does not cause violent crime\" and that drill musicians have become \"both suspects and victims of state-administered racial injustice in an allegedly post-racial era.\"[67] Another paper, published in The British Journal of Criminology, states that: \"Media stories that position drill music as a cause of urban violence also...tend to reaffirm the view that young urban black men—and the forms of culture that appear tied to this population—constitute a threat to the civic mainstream. These stories...appear to have fed into the vague police cultures that sustain racialized stop and search practices in the capital.\"[68] An article by Ciaran Thapar states that, rather than addressing the causes of youth violence, \"those in power are content to target the music that rises, like steam from a pressure cooker, out of these conditions.\"[69] In May 2018,"], "reference": "Minimal techno, originating in the early 1990s with Detroit producers like Robert Hood and Daniel Bell, is characterized by a stripped-down aesthetic, repetition, and understated development, focusing on essential elements like drums, basslines, and funky grooves to make people move.

Music author Richie Unterberger has characterized Miami bass as using rhythms with a \"stop-start flavor\" and \"hissy\" cymbals with lyrics that \"reflected the language of the streets, particularly Miami's historically black neighborhoods such as Liberty City, Goulds, and Overtown\".[1] Despite Miami bass never having consistent mainstream acceptance, early national media attention in the 1980s resulted in a profound impact on the development of hip hop, dance music, and pop.[2] During the 1980s, the focus of Miami bass tended to be on DJs and record producers, rather than individual performers. Record labels such as Pandisc, HOT Records, 4-Sight Records and Skyywalker Records released much material of the genre. Unterberger has referred to James (Maggotron) McCauley (also known as DXJ, Maggozulu Too, Planet Detroit and Bass Master Khan) as the \"father of Miami bass\", a distinction McCauley denies, choosing to confer that status on producer Amos Larkins.[3][2] DJ Kurtis Mantronik (Mantronix) was a key influence on Miami bass. In particular, Mantronik's single \"Bass Machine\" (1986), featuring rap vocals by T La Rock, was pivotal to the development of Miami bass.[4] MC ADE's \"Bass Rock Express\", with music and beats produced by Amos Larkins, is often credited as being the first Miami bass record to gain underground popularity on an international scale.[2] The single \"Throw The D\" by the group 2 Live Crew in 1986 gave a permanent blueprint to how future Miami bass songs were written and produced.[2] 2 Live Crew (Christopher Wong \"Fresh Kid Ice\" Won, Luther \"Luke Skyywalker\" Campbell and David \"Mr. Mixx\" Hobbs) played a key role in popularizing Miami bass in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group's 1986 release, The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are, became controversial for its sexually explicit lyrics. 1989's As Nasty As They Wanna Be, along with its hit single \"Me So Horny\", proved more controversial still, leading to legal troubles for both 2 Live Crew and retailers selling the album. All charges were eventually overturned on appeal.[2] For the better part of the mid-'80s and early '90s, DJs such as Luke Skyywalker's Ghetto Style DJs, Norberto Morales' Triple M DJs, Super JD's MHF DJs, Space Funk DJs, Mohamed Moretta, DJ Nice & Nasty, Felix Sama, DJ Spin, Ramon Hernandez, Bass Master DJs, DJ Laz, Earl \"The Pearl\" Little, Uncle Al, Ser MC, Raylo & Dem Damn Dogs, DJ Slice, K-Bass, Jam Pony Express and others were heavily involved in playing Miami bass at local outdoor events to large audiences at area beaches, parks, and fairs. Clubs in South Florida, including Pac-Jam, Superstars Rollertheque, Bass Station, Studio 183, Randolphs, Nepenthe, Video Powerhouse, Skylight Express, Beat Club and Club Boca, were hosting bass nights on a regular basis. Miami radio airplay and programming support was strong in the now defunct Rhythm 98, as well as WEDR and WPOW (Power 96). Contribution and promotion of Miami bass also came out of Orlando. 102 Jamz (WJHM), a prominent Orlando radio station in the late '80s, featured Miami bass and helped its popularity rise in and around Central Florida.

By the mid-1990s, the influence of Miami bass had spread outside South and Central Florida to all areas of Florida and the Southern United States. In the mid-1990s, it saw a commercial and mainstream resurgence, with Miami bass influenced artists such as L'Trimm, 95 South, Tag Team, 69 Boyz, Quad City DJ's and Freak Nasty all scoring big Miami bass hits. Examples of these songs are \"Whoomp! (There It Is)\" by Tag Team in 1993,[5] \"Tootsee Roll\" by 69 Boyz in 1994,[6] \"C'mon N' Ride It (The Train)\" by the Quad City DJ's in 1996[7] and \"Whoot, There It Is\" by 95 South in 1993.[5] These songs all reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and exposed Miami bass nationally. These artists generally used a Miami bass sound and production but did it in a far less explicit and far more accessible way than had been previously done by Campbell and the 2 Live Crew.[8] Miami bass is closely related to the electronic dance music genres of ghettotech and booty house, genres which combine Detroit techno and Chicago house with the Miami bass sound. Ghettotech follows the same sexually oriented lyrics, hip-hop bass lines and streetwise attitude, but with harder, uptempo Roland TR-909 techno-style kick beats. In 2007, contemporary hip-hop and R&B songs became more dance oriented, showing influences of Miami bass and techno, and are typically sped up to a \"chipmunk\" sound for faster tempos for dances such as juking, wu-tanging and bopping, usually only done in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties in south Florida.[citation needed] Miami bass has been influenced by the cultural history of its wide-ranging community with the evolution of Cuban, Dominican, and Afro-Brazilian-fused sub-genres that include Baltimore club and funk carioca.[9][10] Another subgenre of Miami bass is \"car audio bass\", which features an even more stripped down bass-heavy sound, tending to focus on either extremely hard 909 kicks combined with sine waves or the classic 808 kick, or sometimes simply the sine wave by itself.[citation needed] Some artist examples would be DJ Laz, DJ Magic Mike, Afro-Rican (as Power Supply), Techmaster P.E.B., DJ Billy E, Bass 305 and Bass Patrol.

In 2007, contemporary hip-hop and R&B songs became more dance oriented, showing influences of Miami bass and techno, and are typically sped up to a \"chipmunk\" sound for faster tempos for dances such as juking, wu-tanging and bopping, usually only done in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties in south Florida.[citation needed] Miami bass has been influenced by the cultural history of its wide-ranging community with the evolution of Cuban, Dominican, and Afro-Brazilian-fused sub-genres that include Baltimore club and funk carioca.[9][10] Another subgenre of Miami bass is \"car audio bass\", which features an even more stripped down bass-heavy sound, tending to focus on either extremely hard 909 kicks combined with sine waves or the classic 808 kick, or sometimes simply the sine wave by itself.[citation needed] Some artist examples would be DJ Laz, DJ Magic Mike, Afro-Rican (as Power Supply), Techmaster P.E.B., DJ Billy E, Bass 305 and Bass Patrol. Gqom, an African electronic dance genre that originated in Durban, South Africa, in the early 2010s, is sometimes conflated with Miami bass due to perceived similarities between Durban's cityscape and Miami's South and North Beach areas as well as car culture, with enhanced car sound systems, with an emphasis on bass.", "<2-hop>\n\nHowever, gqom and miami bass are distinct in their origins and their production styles.[11][12]"], "reference": "Gqom is sometimes conflated with Miami bass.

{"user_input": "Considering the origins and evolution of UK drill, how did the group 67 contribute to shaping the genre's sound and what was the impact of their mixtape \\\"Let's Lurk\\\" on the mainstream popularity and distinct British identity of UK drill?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nUK drill received widespread attention outside of Britain in 2017, when comedian Michael Dapaah released the novelty song \"Man's Not Hot\" under the name \"Big Shaq\" or \"Roadman Shaq\". The track sampled a beat made by UK drill producers GottiOnEm and Mazza; it was first used by drill group 86 on its song \"Lurk\", and, later on, 67 on \"Let's Lurk\" featuring Giggs.[11][28][29] Unknown T's song \"Homerton B\" charted on the Official Singles Chart after its August 2018 release, becoming the first UK drill single to do so. The song entered at number 83 on the chart on 28 August 2018, then peaked at 48 in September 2018.[30] UK drill group 67 had two entries into the official charts; however, unlike \"Homerton B\", the entries were on the albums chart and not the singles chart. They reached number 66 in the Official Albums Chart with the mixtape Let's Lurk and number 71 with the mixtape The Glorious Twelfth.[31] Although considered a predominantly trap-based album that implemented some drill features and elements, Section Boyz's mixtape Don't Panic reached number 37 in the UK Albums Chart, later peaking at number 36 in 2015.[32] Canadian musician Drake did a \"Behind Barz\" freestyle for Link Up TV in 2018, where he rapped over a UK drill beat. Drake also credited UK drill artist Loski as an influence for his 2018 album, Scorpion.[33][34] In 2019, Drake released \"War\"; the song used UK drill's production style and was produced by British producer AXL Beats.[35][36] Drake's flow in both instances was reminiscent of UK drill artists.[35][33] In 2020, DigDat released Ei8ht Mile. The mixtape scored the biggest opening week for a UK drill album at the time, opening at number 12.[37] The same year, Skengdo & AM released EU Drillas, a collaborative project that featured drill artists from across Europe;[38] in addition, Headie One released \"Only You Freestyle\" with Drake, which peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart.[39] Towards the end of the year, he released Edna, which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart,[40] becoming the first UK drill album to do so.[41] In 2021, Digga D's mixtape Made in the Pyrex peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the highest-charting UK drill mixtape at the time.[42] In the same year, Tion Wayne and Russ Millions released \"Body\", becoming the first UK drill song to reach Number 1 on the UK Singles Chart.[43] Though the genre originated in London, it is not restricted to London alone as the genre's sole production hub in terms of emerging talents and dissemination of the sound. Artists around the country have appeared and become prominent creators within the scene, such as SmuggzyAce and S.White of Birmingham group 23 Drillas and SV of Nottingham.[44][45] UK drill has spread outside of the United Kingdom, with artists and groups in other countries rapping in styles and using slang terms heavily influenced by UK drill music, and using UK drill instrumentals produced by British producers. Ireland, the Netherlands, and Australia in particular have developed drill scenes that are heavily indebted to UK drill music, with artists such as OneFour in Australia,[46] Offica and A92 in Ireland,[47] and 73 De Pijp from The Netherlands.[48] In addition, artists in Spain making drill music have also taken on influence by its British counterpart, with various references and similar production to UK drill; Spanish drill artists include 970Block[49] and Skinny Flex.[50] Other countries with UK drill-inspired scenes include Ghana and France.[51]", "<2-hop>\n\nUK drill is a subgenre of drill music and road rap that originated in the South London district of Brixton from 2012 onwards.[1][2][3] While being sonically distinct from Chicago drill music,[4] it embraces its aesthetic and melds it with road rap, a British style of gangsta rap that became popular in the years prior to the existence of drill.[2][3][5] UK drill lyrical content tends to be truculent, depicting the harsh realism of their lifestyles.[6][1] The explicit lyricism has stimulated discussion about whether the subgenre is a factor in an increase in knife crime in London.[6][7][8] Gang affiliation and socioeconomically-deprived backgrounds are common amongst UK drill artists.[1] Artists such as 150, 67, Harlem Spartans, 1011, and 410 have been cited as innovators of UK drill. UK drill developed a different production style than the most common Chicago beat patterns, albeit still based on Chicago drill styles originally pioneered by DJ L, a Chicago producer who collaborated with rapper G Herbo in the early Chicago scene.[9] The genre also took influence from earlier British genres such as grime and UK garage; in an interview with Complex, Jammer noted that \"without grime...there would be no UK drill.\"[10] Drill producer Mazza noted that both drill and grime share a similar rawness and energy, despite the two genres remaining distinct from each other. Drill producer Carns Hill, alongside several drill rappers, noted that UK drill should probably have a \"new name\" to distinguish it from the original Chicago drill sound.[11][12] UK drill is generally more fast-paced compared to its Chicago counterpart. UK drill beats are generally structured around an contrast to the typical trap/Chicago drill beat, the hi-hats have moved from on-beat and triplet subdivisions to a steady 3+3+2 polyrhythm, hi-hat pattern, with snares landing on the fourth beat instead of the third every 2 bars. Instrumentals often also have a sliding bass, hard hitting kicks, and dark melodies. AXL Beats explained that the 808s and fast-tempo snares in UK drill are derivative of grime music.[13][14] Both genres typically use a tempo of approximately 138–151 beats per minute.[15][16] Censorship of UK drill lyrics through vocal cuts and mutes is sometimes done to avoid them being used during their prosecution by the police;[17] for example, \"shh\" is used in songs to replace the names of people, weapons and criminal acts.[18] 150 (now known as GBG), a group from the Angell Town Estate in Brixton, is often credited with pioneering UK drill music, with 150 members Stickz, M Dargg and Grizzy (stylized as GR1ZZY) being dedicated exponents of the early style. 67 is often credited for shifting the sound away from the Chicago influences it seemed to heavily draw inspiration from in its early days and foundation and for forming a more homegrown sound.[19] Producers Carns Hill (who crafted instrumentals for many of 67's early songs) and QUIETPVCK (who worked closely by 150 and 410 members in their early era) are widely considered to be two of the main pioneering producers of the genre with their unique and innovative alternatives to the Chicago drill sound.[19][20] An article from VICE divided the history of UK drill into 3 phases; the first of these phases, which lasted from 2014 to 2018, resulted in drill becoming \"its own distinctly British entity\", with the phase peaking in 2016 following the release of \"Let's Lurk\" by 67, featuring Giggs. Given that the genre was \"locked out\" of the mainstream music industry due to its uncensored nature, music videos became a major player in the genre's circulation.[21] Its uncensored nature also resulted in Form 696 being used to cancel shows by drill artists.[22] In early 2017, \"Kennington Where It Started\" was released by the Harlem Spartans, considered by fans to have turned UK drill from an underground genre into a mainstream one.[23] In 2018, members of 1011 (now known as CGM), including Digga D, were given a court order that banned them from making music without police permission; in addition, they couldn't mention death or injury, including the death of Abdullahi Tarabi, and had to notify police in advance of any song releases or performances. Kevin Southworth, Detective Chief Superintendent, noted that it was \"one of the first times\" that such an order was made. The order was condemned by Index on Censorship.[24] In 2019, Skengdo & AM, members of drill group 410, were handed a 9-month suspended sentence, suspended for 2 years, for breaching a gang injunction.[25] According to The Guardian, the injunction, which lasted until January 2021, prevented Skengdo & AM, as well as 2 other members of 410, from entering the SE11 postcode, as well as prohibiting them from performing songs that had lyrics mentioning rival crews, their rappers or any mentions to them entering the territory of other groups.[26] The sentence resulted in a letter being signed by 65 people that was addressed to the Metropolitan Police, calling upon them to stop issuing gang injunctions and stating that musicians should be given the rights of freedom of speech and creative expression.[27]"], "reference": "UK drill originated in Brixton, South London, around 2012.
