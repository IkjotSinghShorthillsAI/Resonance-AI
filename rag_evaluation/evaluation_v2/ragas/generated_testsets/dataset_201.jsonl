{"user_input": "I'm looking for some new sounds. Can you tell me about the band \\\"Incognito\\\" in the context of acid jazz?", "reference_contexts": ["Acid jazz (also known as club jazz, psychedelic jazz, or groove jazz) is a music genre that combines elements of funk, soul, and hip hop, as well as jazz and disco.[1][2] Acid jazz originated in clubs in London during the 1980s with the rare groove movement and spread to the United States, Western Europe, Latin America and Japan. Acts included The Brand New Heavies, Incognito, James Taylor Quartet, Us3, and Jamiroquai from the UK, and Guru, Buckshot LeFonque and Digable Planets from the U.S. The rise of electronic club music in the middle to late 1990s led to a decline in interest, and in the twenty-first century, acid jazz became indistinct as a genre. Many acts that might have been defined as acid jazz are seen as jazz-funk, or nu jazz. The genre's name was likely coined by Gilles Peterson, and the label was started by Bangs, Eddie Piller, and Gilles.[3][4] The name refers to the acid house genre, which was popular in UK clubs in the 1980s.[5] However, DJs Femi Williams and Marco Nelson from Young Disciples claimed in a recently unearthed 1992 TV interview that they coined the term because they had a club with acid playing downstairs and jazz upstairs, so they thought it would be amusing to name the upstairs room \"The Acid Jazz Room\".[6] The veracity of this claim predating Peterson's is dubious, as the interview in question took place five years after the Acid Jazz label was created, and Young Disciples were first active three years after the formation of the label.[7] Acid jazz consisted of two related movements. The first was based on records by disc jockeys and music producers who added percussion and electronic dance beats to jazz tracks from the 1960s and 1970s.[8] The second movement included groups who were influenced by these recordings and who emphasized a groove.[5] Acid jazz borrowed from jazz, funk, and hip-hop. Because it relies heavily on percussion and live performance, it is sometimes associated with jazz, but its emphasis on groove aligns it more with funk, hip hop, and dance music.[9] The style is characterized by danceable grooves and long, repetitive compositions. Acid jazz bands usually include horns, a rhythm section (bass guitar, drum set and additional percussion), a vocalist who may sing or rap, and a DJ.[10] Acid jazz has its origins in the 1950s, 1960s, when psychedelic styles were being incorporated into other musical genres, jazz being one of these. Acid jazz became popular in London clubs during the 1980s when disc jockeys associated with the rare groove movement played obscure jazz records. Their interests were in the fringe of jazz fusion, jazz funk, and the soul jazz of 1960s. Particularly significant were records from the Blue Note catalogue.[4] These DJs included Gilles Peterson, who had residencies at several London clubs in the 1980s. Peterson began in a small pirate radio station and then moved to the larger Kiss-FM. In 1988 with producer Eddie Piller he formed the label Acid Jazz Records. The first release from the company was the compilation Totally Wired, which contained obscure jazz funk tracks from the 1970s with updated new tracks.[4] In 1990 Peterson left to start the label Talkin' Loud at Phonogram.[11] The company signed Galliano, Young Disciples, and Urban Species.[4] Another British record label, Fourth and Broadway Records, was formed in 1990 and began a compilation series with the title \"The Rebirth of Cool\". The label's roster included Pharoah Sanders, Stereo MCs, MC Solaar, and Courtney Pine.[4] In 1991 acid jazz broke into the mainstream with the success of Brand New Heavies. After one self-titled album (1990) with Acid Jazz Records, the group signed with FFRR Records and had the hit singles \"Never Stop\" and \"Dream Come True\".[4] Other bands included Incognito and Us3, whose \"Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)\" (1993) was the biggest hit in the genre.[12] Also successful was Jamiroquai, an early act for Acid Jazz Records that signed with Sony, which released Travelling Without Moving (1996) and the hit single \"Virtual Insanity\".[5] Other live acts included Stereo MCs and the James Taylor Quartet.[9] The mainstream success of acid jazz was followed by many compilations which left the public confused about the genre.[4] Acid jazz spread to the United States in the early 1990s.[4] It reached New York City in 1990 when British promoter Maurice Bernstein and his South African partner Jonathan Rudnick opened Groove Academy as a party at the Giant Step club in the basement of the Metropolis Café in Union Square. Groove Academy turned into a record label and media company.[13] Acid jazz musicians in New York City included Brooklyn Funk Essentials, DJ Smash, and Jerome Van Rossum. In San Francisco acid jazz was released by Ubiquity Records,[4] by Solsonics in Los Angeles, and The Greyboy Allstars in San Diego.[14] A Tribe Called Quest borrowed from jazz for their album The Low End Theory (1991).[8] Under the name Buckshot LeFonque, Branford Marsalis and Digable Planets won a Grammy Award for the 1993 single \"Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)\".[12] Formed in New York in 1990, Groove Collective produced their self-titled debut in 1993.[5] The rapper Guru released a series of albums recorded with jazz musicians as the Jazzmatazz series.[8] Stemming from Chicago in 1993, Liquid Soul achieved a national profile in 1996 when their self-titled debut LP was re-released by Ark21.[15] In 2000 their album Here's the Deal was nominated in the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album category.[16] Acid jazz soon gained an international following, including in Japan, Germany, Brazil and Eastern Europe.[8] From Japan, United Future Organization gained an international reputation, signing an American record deal in 1994.[17] Other acts include Mondo Grosso[9] and Gota Yashiki[18] in Japan, and Skalpel in Poland.[19] The rise of electronic club music in the mid- to late-1990s led to a decline in interest in acid jazz among the record buying public, although the genre continued to have a reduced worldwide following.[4] In the twenty-first century the movement became so intertwined with other forms that"], "reference": "Incognito is listed as one of the acid jazz acts from the UK.

{"user_input": "As a DJ always looking for fresh sounds, can you give me a detailed rundown on Portishead's role in pioneering trip hop and how their sound fits into the broader context of the genre's origins and influences?", "reference_contexts": ["Trip hop is a musical genre that originated in the late 1980s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol, England.[3] It has been described as a psychedelic fusion of hip hop and electronica with slow tempos and an atmospheric sound,[4][5][6] often incorporating elements of jazz, soul, funk, reggae, dub, R&B, and other genres, typically of electronic music, as well as sampling from movie soundtracks and other eclectic sources.[7] The style emerged as a more experimental variant of breakbeat from the Bristol sound scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s,[8] incorporating influences from jazz, soul, funk, dub, and rap music.[9] It was pioneered by acts like Massive Attack, UNKLE, Tricky, and Portishead.[10] The term was first coined in a 1994 Mixmag piece about American producer DJ Shadow.[11] Trip hop achieved commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as \"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\".[8] Common musical aesthetics include a bass-heavy drumbeat,[12] often providing the slowed down breakbeat samples similar to standard 1990s hip hop beats, giving the genre a more psychedelic and mainstream feel.[12] Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&B, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&B, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack[13] and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird,[14] and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps.[15] Trip hop is also known for its melancholic sound. This may be partly due to the fact that several acts were inspired by post-punk bands;[16] Tricky and Massive Attack both covered and sampled songs of Siouxsie and the Banshees[17][18] and the Cure.[19][20] Tricky opened his second album Nearly God with a version of \"Tattoo\", a proto-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees initially recorded in 1983.[21] Trip hop tracks often incorporate Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments such as the theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop differs from hip hop in theme and overall tone. Contrasting with gangsta rap and its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural atmospherics influenced by experimental folk and rock acts of the seventies, such as John Martyn,[22] combined with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop may be said to \"transcend\" the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo.[23] The term \"trip-hop\" first appeared in print in June 1994.[11] Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, used it to describe \"In/Flux\", a single by American producer DJ Shadow and UK act RPM, with the latter signed to Mo' Wax Records.[24][25] In Bristol, hip hop began to seep into the consciousness of a subculture already well-schooled in Jamaican forms of music. DJs, MCs, b-boys and graffiti artists grouped together into informal soundsystems.[26] Like the pioneering Bronx crews of DJs Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, the soundsystems provided party music for public spaces, often in the economically deprived council estates from which some of their members originated. Bristol's soundsystem DJs, drawing heavily on Jamaican dub music, typically used a laid-back, slow and heavy drum beat (\"down tempo\"). Bristol's Wild Bunch crew became one of the soundsystems to put a local spin on the international phenomenon, helping to birth Bristol's signature sound of trip hop, often termed \"the Bristol Sound\".[26] The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence, DJ Milo (Milo Johnson, aka DJ Nature) founding member of the Wild Bunch and the person generally accepted as the creator of the Bristol sound and therefore, trip-hop; MC Adrian \"Tricky Kid\" Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles and Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s,[27] the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack,[28] a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists.[28] Another influence came from Gary Clail's Tackhead soundsystem. Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart.[29] The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart & the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label.[30] Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a premature version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released \"Angel\", one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s. Massive Attack's first album Blue Lines was released in 1991 to huge success in the United Kingdom.[32] Blue Lines was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album's hit single \"Unfinished Sympathy\" and other tracks were not seen as hip hop songs in a conventional sense despite similarities in production methods such as using sample-based rhythms. Co-produced by Jonny Dollar, the orchestral \"Unfinished\" featured R&B singer Shara Nelson, and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack's career.[33] Massive Attack released their second album entitled Protection in 1994. Although Tricky stayed on in a lesser role and Hooper again produced, the fertile dance music scene of the early 1990s had informed the record, and it was seen as an even more significant shift away"], "reference": "According to the provided text, Portishead is one of the acts that pioneered trip hop.

{"user_input": "Mo' Wax, what that?", "reference_contexts": ["from the Wild Bunch era. In the June 1994 issue of the UK magazine Mixmag, music journalist Andy Pemberton used the term trip hop to describe the hip hop instrumental \"In/Flux\", a 1993 single by San Francisco's DJ Shadow, and other similar tracks released on the Mo' Wax label and being played in London clubs at the time. \"In/Flux\", with its mixed up bpms, spoken word samples, strings, melodies, bizarre noises, prominent bass, and slow beats, gave the listener the impression they were on a musical trip, according to Pemberton.[34] Soon, however, Massive Attack's dubby, jazzy, psychedelic, electronic textures, rooted in hip hop sampling technique but taking flight into many styles, were described by journalists as the template of the eponymous genre. In 1993, Icelandic musician Björk released Debut, produced by Wild Bunch member Nellee Hooper.[35] The album, although rooted in four-on-the-floor house music, contained elements of trip hop and is credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop.[36][37] She had been in contact with London's underground electronic music scene and was romantically involved with trip-hop musician Tricky. Björk further embraced trip-hop with her 1995 album Post by collaborating with Tricky and Howie B. Homogenic, her 1997 album, has been described as a pinnacle of trip hop music.[38] Trip-hop neared the peak of its popularity in 1994 and 1995, with artists such as Howie B and Earthling making significant contributions. Ninja Tune, the independent record label founded by the duo Coldcut, significantly influenced the trip-hop sound in London and beyond with breakthrough artists DJ Food, 9 Lazy 9, Up, Bustle & Out, Funki Porcini and The Herbaliser, among others. The period also marked the debut of two acts who, along with Massive Attack, would define the Bristol scene for years to come. In 1994, Portishead, a trio comprising singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released their debut album Dummy. Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs.[39] Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year,[40] giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music was also widely imitated, to the point that they distanced themselves[41] from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize, with Barrow stating \"The whole trip-hop tag was nonsense. It was developed by people in London, and the people in Bristol just had to put up with it.\".[42] Tricky also released his debut solo album, Maxinquaye in 1995, to great critical acclaim. The album was produced largely in collaboration with Mark Saunders. Tricky employed whispered, often abstract stream-of-consciousness lyrics, remote from the gangsta-rap braggadocio of the mid-1990s US hip-hop scene. Even more unusually, many of the solo songs on Maxinquaye featured little of Tricky's own voice: his then-lover, Martina Topley-Bird, sang them, including her re-imagining of rap group Public Enemy's 1988 song \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\", while other songs were male-female duets dealing with sex and love in oblique ways, over beds of sometimes dissonant samples. Within a year, Tricky had released two more full-length albums, although they failed to find the same popularity as his Bristol contemporaries Massive Attack and Portishead.[43] Through his collaborations with Björk, however, he exerted influence closer to the pop and alternative rock mainstream, and he developed a large cult fan-base. Although not as popular in the United States, bands like Portishead and Sneaker Pimps saw moderate airplay on alternative-rock stations across the country.[44] After the initial success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, the artists who made their own interpretations of the genre include Archive, Baby Fox, Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Anomie Belle,[48] Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists incorporated trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed use of the term \"post-trip hop\" was in an October 2002 article of The Independent, and was used to describe the band Second Person.[49] Trip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, PJ Harvey,[50] How to Destroy Angels,[51] Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, Bitter:Sweet, Beck, Alanis Morissette, The xx and Deftones.[52] Several tracks on Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue's 1997 album Impossible Princess also displayed a trip hop influence.[53][importance of example(s)?] Various prominent artists and groups, such as Janet Jackson,[54] Kylie Minogue,[55] Madonna,[56][57] Björk,[58][59][60] and Radiohead,[61] have also been influenced by the genre. Trip hop has spawned several subgenres,[62] including illbient (dub-based trip hop which combines ambient and industrial hip hop). Trip hop continued to influence notable artists in the 2000s. Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver incorporated trip hop in their ambient/electronic/jazzy album Perdition City. Atmospheric rock band Antimatter included some trip hop elements in their first two albums. Australian composer Rob Dougan proposed a mix of trip hop beats, orchestral music and electronics. RJD2 began his career as a DJ, but in 2001, began releasing albums under El-P's Def Jux Label.[63] Zero 7's album Simple Things, and in particular, its lead single \"Destiny\", was regarded highly by underground listeners and achieved significant popularity.[64] In 2006, Gotye debuted his second studio album, Like Drawing Blood. The songs on the album featured down-tempo hip-hop beats and dub style bass reminiscent of trip hop.[65] Hip hop groups Zion I and the Dub Pistols also displayed heavy trip hop influence.[66][67] Norwegian singer and songwriter Kate Havnevik is a classically trained musician, but also incorporates trip hop into her work.[68] During the late 1990s and early 2000s trip hop achieved crossover success in the United States, often lumped under the \"electronica\" label.

The songs on the album featured down-tempo hip-hop beats and dub style bass reminiscent of trip hop.[65] Hip hop groups Zion I and the Dub Pistols also displayed heavy trip hop influence.[66][67] Norwegian singer and songwriter Kate Havnevik is a classically trained musician, but also incorporates trip hop into her work.[68] During the late 1990s and early 2000s trip hop achieved crossover success in the United States, often lumped under the \"electronica\" label.

{"user_input": "Can you elaborate on the genre definition and origins of trip hop, specifically mentioning the first use of the term and its connection to the Bristol sound?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nTrip hop is a musical genre that originated in the late 1980s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol, England.[3] It has been described as a psychedelic fusion of hip hop and electronica with slow tempos and an atmospheric sound,[4][5][6] often incorporating elements of jazz, soul, funk, reggae, dub, R&B, and other genres, typically of electronic music, as well as sampling from movie soundtracks and other eclectic sources.[7] The style emerged as a more experimental variant of breakbeat from the Bristol sound scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s,[8] incorporating influences from jazz, soul, funk, dub, and rap music.[9] It was pioneered by acts like Massive Attack, UNKLE, Tricky, and Portishead.[10] The term was first coined in a 1994 Mixmag piece about American producer DJ Shadow.[11] Trip hop achieved commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as \"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\".[8] Common musical aesthetics include a bass-heavy drumbeat,[12] often providing the slowed down breakbeat samples similar to standard 1990s hip hop beats, giving the genre a more psychedelic and mainstream feel.[12] Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&B, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&B, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack[13] and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird,[14] and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps.[15] Trip hop is also known for its melancholic sound. This may be partly due to the fact that several acts were inspired by post-punk bands;[16] Tricky and Massive Attack both covered and sampled songs of Siouxsie and the Banshees[17][18] and the Cure.[19][20] Tricky opened his second album Nearly God with a version of \"Tattoo\", a proto-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees initially recorded in 1983.[21] Trip hop tracks often incorporate Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments such as the theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop differs from hip hop in theme and overall tone. Contrasting with gangsta rap and its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural atmospherics influenced by experimental folk and rock acts of the seventies, such as John Martyn,[22] combined with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop may be said to \"transcend\" the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo.[23] The term \"trip-hop\" first appeared in print in June 1994.[11] Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, used it to describe \"In/Flux\", a single by American producer DJ Shadow and UK act RPM, with the latter signed to Mo' Wax Records.[24][25] In Bristol, hip hop began to seep into the consciousness of a subculture already well-schooled in Jamaican forms of music. DJs, MCs, b-boys and graffiti artists grouped together into informal soundsystems.[26] Like the pioneering Bronx crews of DJs Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, the soundsystems provided party music for public spaces, often in the economically deprived council estates from which some of their members originated. Bristol's soundsystem DJs, drawing heavily on Jamaican dub music, typically used a laid-back, slow and heavy drum beat (\"down tempo\"). Bristol's Wild Bunch crew became one of the soundsystems to put a local spin on the international phenomenon, helping to birth Bristol's signature sound of trip hop, often termed \"the Bristol Sound\".[26] The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence, DJ Milo (Milo Johnson, aka DJ Nature) founding member of the Wild Bunch and the person generally accepted as the creator of the Bristol sound and therefore, trip-hop; MC Adrian \"Tricky Kid\" Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles and Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s,[27] the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack,[28] a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists.[28] Another influence came from Gary Clail's Tackhead soundsystem. Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart.[29] The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart & the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label.[30] Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a premature version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released \"Angel\", one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s. Massive Attack's first album Blue Lines was released in 1991 to huge success in the United Kingdom.[32] Blue Lines was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album's hit single \"Unfinished Sympathy\" and other tracks were not seen as hip hop songs in a conventional sense despite similarities in production methods such as using sample-based rhythms. Co-produced by Jonny Dollar, the orchestral \"Unfinished\" featured R&B singer Shara Nelson, and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack's career.[33] Massive Attack released their second album entitled Protection in 1994. Although Tricky stayed on in a lesser role and Hooper again produced, the fertile dance music scene of the early 1990s had informed the record, and it was seen as an even more significant shift away", "<2-hop>\n\nfrom the Wild Bunch era. In the June 1994 issue of the UK magazine Mixmag, music journalist Andy Pemberton used the term trip hop to describe the hip hop instrumental \"In/Flux\", a 1993 single by San Francisco's DJ Shadow, and other similar tracks released on the Mo' Wax label and being played in London clubs at the time. \"In/Flux\", with its mixed up bpms, spoken word samples, strings, melodies, bizarre noises, prominent bass, and slow beats, gave the listener the impression they were on a musical trip, according to Pemberton.[34] Soon, however, Massive Attack's dubby, jazzy, psychedelic, electronic textures, rooted in hip hop sampling technique but taking flight into many styles, were described by journalists as the template of the eponymous genre. In 1993, Icelandic musician Björk released Debut, produced by Wild Bunch member Nellee Hooper.[35] The album, although rooted in four-on-the-floor house music, contained elements of trip hop and is credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop.[36][37] She had been in contact with London's underground electronic music scene and was romantically involved with trip-hop musician Tricky. Björk further embraced trip-hop with her 1995 album Post by collaborating with Tricky and Howie B. Homogenic, her 1997 album, has been described as a pinnacle of trip hop music.[38] Trip-hop neared the peak of its popularity in 1994 and 1995, with artists such as Howie B and Earthling making significant contributions. Ninja Tune, the independent record label founded by the duo Coldcut, significantly influenced the trip-hop sound in London and beyond with breakthrough artists DJ Food, 9 Lazy 9, Up, Bustle & Out, Funki Porcini and The Herbaliser, among others. The period also marked the debut of two acts who, along with Massive Attack, would define the Bristol scene for years to come. In 1994, Portishead, a trio comprising singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released their debut album Dummy. Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs.[39] Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year,[40] giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music was also widely imitated, to the point that they distanced themselves[41] from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize, with Barrow stating \"The whole trip-hop tag was nonsense. It was developed by people in London, and the people in Bristol just had to put up with it.\".[42] Tricky also released his debut solo album, Maxinquaye in 1995, to great critical acclaim. The album was produced largely in collaboration with Mark Saunders. Tricky employed whispered, often abstract stream-of-consciousness lyrics, remote from the gangsta-rap braggadocio of the mid-1990s US hip-hop scene. Even more unusually, many of the solo songs on Maxinquaye featured little of Tricky's own voice: his then-lover, Martina Topley-Bird, sang them, including her re-imagining of rap group Public Enemy's 1988 song \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\", while other songs were male-female duets dealing with sex and love in oblique ways, over beds of sometimes dissonant samples. Within a year, Tricky had released two more full-length albums, although they failed to find the same popularity as his Bristol contemporaries Massive Attack and Portishead.[43] Through his collaborations with Björk, however, he exerted influence closer to the pop and alternative rock mainstream, and he developed a large cult fan-base. Although not as popular in the United States, bands like Portishead and Sneaker Pimps saw moderate airplay on alternative-rock stations across the country.[44] After the initial success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, the artists who made their own interpretations of the genre include Archive, Baby Fox, Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Anomie Belle,[48] Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists incorporated trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed use of the term \"post-trip hop\" was in an October 2002 article of The Independent, and was used to describe the band Second Person.[49] Trip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, PJ Harvey,[50] How to Destroy Angels,[51] Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, Bitter:Sweet, Beck, Alanis Morissette, The xx and Deftones.[52] Several tracks on Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue's 1997 album Impossible Princess also displayed a trip hop influence.[53][importance of example(s)?] Various prominent artists and groups, such as Janet Jackson,[54] Kylie Minogue,[55] Madonna,[56][57] Björk,[58][59][60] and Radiohead,[61] have also been influenced by the genre. Trip hop has spawned several subgenres,[62] including illbient (dub-based trip hop which combines ambient and industrial hip hop). Trip hop continued to influence notable artists in the 2000s. Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver incorporated trip hop in their ambient/electronic/jazzy album Perdition City. Atmospheric rock band Antimatter included some trip hop elements in their first two albums. Australian composer Rob Dougan proposed a mix of trip hop beats, orchestral music and electronics.

{"user_input": "Considering the cultural significance of Chicago underground club culture and its role in fostering freedom of expression, how did early house music lyrics reflect these themes, particularly for marginalized communities?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\ninclude movements from many other forms of dance, such as waacking, voguing, capoeira, jazz dance, Lindy Hop, tap dance, and even modern dance.[45][44] House dancing is associated with a complete freedom of expression.[46] One of the primary elements in house dancing is \"the jack\" or \"jacking\" — a style created in the early days of Chicago house that left its trace in numerous record titles such as \"Time to Jack\" by Chip E. from the Jack Trax EP (1985), \"Jack'n the House\" by Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk (1985) or \"Jack Your Body\" by Steve \"Silk\" Hurley (1986). It involves moving the torso forward and backward in a rippling motion matching the beat of the music, as if a wave were passing through it.[46] Early house lyrics contained generally positive, uplifting messages, but spoke especially to those who were considered to be outsiders, especially African Americans, Latinos, and the gay subculture. The house music dance scene was one of the most integrated and progressive spaces in the 1980s; the black and gay populations, as well as other minority groups, were able to dance together in a positive environment.[47] House music DJs aimed to create a \"dream world of emotions\" with \"stories, keywords and sounds\", which helped to \"glue\" communities together.[18] Many house tracks encourage the audience to \"release yourself\" or \"let yourself go\", which is further encouraged by the continuous dancing, \"incessant beat\", and use of club drugs, which can create a trance-like effect on dancers.[18] Frankie Knuckles once said that the Warehouse club in Chicago was like \"church for people who have fallen from grace\". House record producer Marshall Jefferson compared it to \"old-time religion in the way that people just get happy and screamin'\".[46] The role of a house DJ has been compared to a \"secular type of priest\".[18] Some house lyrics contained messages calling for equality, unity, and freedom of expression beyond racial or sexual differences (e.g. \"Can You Feel It\" by Fingers Inc., 1987, or \"Follow Me\" by Aly-Us, 1992). Later on in the 1990s, independently from the Chicago scene, the idea of Peace, Love, Unity & Respect (PLUR) became a widespread set of principles for the rave culture.[48] One of the main influences of house was disco, house music having been defined as a genre which \"...picked up where disco left off in the late 1970's\".[49][50] Like disco DJs, house DJs used a \"slow mix\" to \"lin[k] records together\" into a mix.[18] In the post-disco club culture during the early 1980s, DJs from the gay scene made their tracks \"less pop-oriented\", with a more mechanical, repetitive beat and deeper basslines, and many tracks were made without vocals, or with wordless melodies.[51] Disco became so popular by the late 1970s that record companies pushed even non-disco artists (R&B and soft rock acts, for example) to record disco songs. When the backlash against disco started, known as \"Disco Demolition Night\", held in Chicago, ironically the city where house music would be created a few years later, dance music went from being produced by major labels to being created by DJs in the underground club scene. That is until several years later by 1988, when major labels would begin signing acts from this new dance genre.[18] While disco was associated with lush orchestration, with string orchestra, flutes and horn sections, various later disco songs incorporated sounds produced with synthesizers and electronic drum machines, and some compositions were entirely electronic: one of the earliest examples includes Italian composer Giorgio Moroder's late 1970s productions such as Donna Summer's hit single \"I Feel Love\" (1977), or albums like Cerrone's Supernature (1977),[52] Kraftwerk's The Man-Machine (1978),[53] Yellow Magic Orchestra's synth- and disco-pop productions from Yellow Magic Orchestra (1978) or Solid State Survivor (1979),[54][55] and several early 1980s productions by Hi-NRG groups like Lime, Trans-X and Bobby O. Also important for the development of house were audio mixing and editing techniques earlier explored by disco, garage house and post-disco DJs, record producers, and audio engineers such as Walter Gibbons, Tom Moulton, Jim Burgess, Larry Levan, M & M, and others. While most post-disco disc jockeys primarily stuck to playing their conventional ensemble and playlist of dance records, Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy, two influential DJs of house music, were known for their unusual and non-mainstream playlists and mixing. Knuckles, often credited as \"the Godfather of House\" and resident DJ at the Warehouse club in Chicago from 1977 to 1982, worked primarily with early disco music with a hint of new and different post-punk or post-disco music.[56] Knuckles started out as a disco DJ, but when he moved from New York City to Chicago, he changed from the typical disco mixing style of playing records one after another; instead, he mixed different songs together, including Philadelphia soul and Euro disco.[21] He also explored adding a drum machine and a reel-to-reel tape player so he could create new tracks, often with a boosted deep register and faster tempos. Knuckles said: \"Kraftwerk were main components in the creation of house music in Chicago. Back in the early '80s, I mixed our '80s Philly sound with the electro beats of Kraftwerk and the Electronic body music bands of Europe.\"[21][57] Ron Hardy produced unconventional DIY mixtapes which he later played straight-on in the successor of the Warehouse, the Music Box (reopened and renamed in 1983 after Knuckles left). Like Frankie Knuckles, Hardy \"combined certain sounds, remixing tracks with added synths and drum machines\", all \"refracted through the futurist lens of European music\".[19] Marshall Jefferson, who would later appear with the 1986 house classic \"Move Your Body (The House Music Anthem)\" (originally released on Trax Records), describes how he got involved in house music after hearing Ron Hardy's music in the Music Box: \"I wasn't even into dance music before I went to the Music Box [...]. I was into rock and roll. We would get drunk and listen to rock and roll. We didn't give a fuck, we were like 'Disco Sucks!' and all that. I hated dance music 'cos", "<2-hop>\n\nHouse is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat and a typical tempo of 115–130 beats per minute.[11] It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago's underground club culture and evolved slowly in the early/mid 1980s as DJs began altering disco songs to give them a more mechanical beat.[1][12] By early 1988, house became mainstream and supplanted the typical 80s music beat.[13] House was created and pioneered by DJs and producers in Chicago such as Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E., Joe Smooth, Steve \"Silk\" Hurley, Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture, and others. House music initially expanded to New York City, then internationally to cities such as London, and ultimately became a worldwide phenomenon.[14] House has a large influence on pop music, especially dance music. It was incorporated into works by major international artists including Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Pet Shop Boys, Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga, and produced many mainstream hits such as \"Pump Up the Jam\" by Technotronic, \"French Kiss\" by Lil Louis, \"Show Me Love\" by Robin S., and \"Push the Feeling On\" by the Nightcrawlers. Many house DJs also did and continue to do remixes for pop artists. House music has remained popular on radio and in clubs while retaining a foothold on the underground scenes across the globe. In its most typical form, the genre is characterized by repetitive 4/4 rhythms including bass drums, off-beat hi-hats, snare drums, claps, and/or snaps at a tempo of between 120 and 130 beats per minute (bpm); synthesizer riffs; deep basslines; and often, but not necessarily, sung, spoken or sampled vocals. In house, the bass drum is usually played on beats one, two, three, and four, and the snare drum, claps, or other higher-pitched percussion on beats two and four. The drumbeats in house music are almost always provided by an electronic drum machine, often a Roland TR-808, TR-909,[15] or a TR-707. Claps, shakers, snare drum, or hi-hat sounds are used to add syncopation.[16] One of the signature rhythm riffs, especially in early I couldn't dance. I thought dance music was kind of wimpy, until I heard it at like Music Box volume.\" A precursor to house music is the Colonel Abrams' hit song \"Trapped\", which was produced by Richard James Burgess in 1984[59] and has been referred to as a proto-house track and a precursor to \"garage house music\", a subgenre also called \"garage music\" that actually consisted of the New York City/New Jersey scene of the main genre.[60] The electronic instrumentation and minimal arrangement of Charanjit Singh's Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat (1982), an album of Indian ragas performed in a disco style and anticipated the sounds of acid house music, but it is not known to have had any influence on the genre prior to the album's rediscovery in the 21st century.[61][62][63] According to Hillegonda C. Rietveld, \"elements of hip hop/rap music can be found in contemporary house tracks\", with hip hop acting as an \"accent or inflection\" that is inserted into the house sound.[18] The constant bass drum in house music may have arisen from DJs experimenting with adding drum machines to their live mixes at clubs, underneath the records they were playing.[64] In the early 1980s, Chicago radio jocks Hot Mix 5 from WBMX radio station (among them Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk), and club DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles played a range of styles of dance music, including older disco records (mostly Philly disco and Salsoul[65] tracks), electro funk tracks by artists such as Afrika Bambaataa,[6] newer Italo disco, Arthur Baker, and John Robie, and electronic pop.[1] Some DJs made and played their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape, and sometimes mixed in electronic effects, drum machines, synthesizers and other rhythmic electronic instrumentation. The hypnotic electronic dance song \"On and On\", produced in 1984 by Chicago DJ Jesse Saunders and co-written by Vince Lawrence, had typical elements of the early house sound, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer and minimal vocals, as well as a Roland TR-808 drum machine and a Korg Poly-61 synthesizer. It also utilized the bassline from Player One's disco record \"Space Invaders\" (1979).[66] \"On and On\" is sometimes cited as the \"first house record\",[67][68] even though it was a remake of a Disco Bootleg \"On and On\" by Florida producer Mach. Other examples from around that time, such as J.M. Silk's \"Music is the Key\" (1985), have also been referred to as the first house tracks.[69][70] Starting in 1985 and 1986, more and more Chicago DJs began producing and releasing original compositions. These compositions used newly affordable electronic instruments and enhanced styles of disco and other dance music they already favored. These homegrown productions were played on Chicago radio stations and in local clubs catering mainly to black, Mexican American, and gay audiences.[71][72][73][74][75][76] Subgenres of house, including deep house and acid house, quickly emerged and gained traction.[27]", "<3-hop>\n\nOnly Way Is Up\" by Yazz.[92][93] One of the early club anthems, \"Promised Land\" by Joe Smooth, was covered and charted within a week by UK band The Style Council. Europeans embraced house, and began booking important American house DJs to play at the big clubs, such as Ministry of Sound, whose resident, Justin Berkmann brought in US pioneer Larry Levan.[94] The house music club scene in cities such as Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Wolverhampton, and London were provided with dance tracks by many underground pirate radio stations. Club DJs also brought in new house styles, which helped bolster this music genre. The earliest UK house and techno record labels, such as Warp Records and Network Records (formed out of Kool Kat records), helped introduce American and later Italian dance music to Britain. These labels also promoted UK dance music acts. By the end of the 1980s, UK DJs Jenö, Thomas, Markie and Garth moved to San Francisco and called their group the Wicked Crew. The Wicked Crew's dance sound transmitted UK styles to the US, which helped to trigger the birth of the US west coast's rave scene.[95] The manager of Manchester's Factory nightclub and co-owner of The Haçienda, Tony Wilson, also promoted acid house culture on his weekly TV show. The UK midlands also embraced the late 1980s house scene with illegal parties and raves and more legal dance clubs such as The Hummingbird.[96] While the acid house hype spawned in the UK and Europe, in Chicago it reached its peak around 1988 and then declined in popularity.[citation needed] Instead, a crossover of house and hip-hop music, known as hip house, became popular. Tyree Cooper's single \"Turn Up the Bass\" featuring Kool Rock Steady from 1988 was an influential breakthrough for this subgenre, although the British trio the Beatmasters claimed having invented the genre with their 1986 release \"Rok da House\".[citation needed] Another notable figure in the hip house scene was Fast Eddie with \"Hip House\" and \"Yo Yo Get Funky!\" (both 1988). Even Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk engaged in the genre, releasing \"Free at Last\", a song to free James Brown from jail that featured The Hip House Syndicate, in 1989, and producing a Real Hip House compilation on his label, House Records, in 1990. The early 1990s saw new Chicago house artists emerge, such as Armando Gallop, who had released seminal acid house records since 1987, but became even more influential by co-founding the new Warehouse nightclub in Chicago (on 738 W. Randolph Street[97]) in which he also was resident DJ from 1992 until 1994, and founding Warehouse Records in 1988.[98] Another important figure during the early to mid-1990s and until the 2000s was DJ and producer Paul Johnson, who released the Warehouse-anthem \"Welcome to the Warehouse\" on Armando's label in 1994 in collaboration with Armando himself. He also had part in the development of an entirely new kind of Chicago house sound, \"ghetto house\", which was prominently released and popularized through the Dance Mania record label. It was originally founded by Jesse Saunders in 1985 but passed on to Raymond Barney in 1988. It featured notable ghetto house artists like DJ Funk, DJ Deeon, DJ Milton, Paul Johnson and others. The label is regarded as hugely influential in the history of Chicago house music, and has been described as \"ghetto house's Motown\".[99] One of the prototypes for Dance Mania's new ghetto house sound was the single \"(It's Time for the) Percolator\" by Cajmere, also known as Green Velvet, from 1992.[100] Cajmere started the labels Cajual Records and Relief Records, the latter combining the sound of Chicago, acid, and ghetto house with the harder sound of techno. By the early 1990s, artists of note on those two labels included Dajae, DJ Sneak, Derrick Carter, DJ Rush, Paul Johnson, Joe Lewis, and Glenn Underground. While house became popular in UK and continental Europe, the scene in the US had still not progressed beyond a small number of clubs in Chicago, Detroit, New York City, and Newark. In New York and Newark, the terms \"garage house\", \"garage music\", or simply \"garage\", and \"Jersey sound\", or \"New Jersey house\", were coined for a deeper, more soulful, R&B-derived subgenre of house that was developed in the Paradise Garage nightclub in New York City and Club Zanzibar in Newark, New Jersey, during the early-to-mid 1980s. It is argued that garage house predates the development of Chicago house, as it is relatively closer to disco than other dance styles.[101] As Chicago house gained international popularity, New York and New Jersey's music scene was distinguished from the \"house\" umbrella.[101][102] In comparison to other forms of house music, garage house, and Jersey sound include more gospel-influenced piano riffs and female vocals.[103] The genre was popular in the 1980s in the United States and in the 1990s in the United Kingdom.[103] DJs playing it include Tony Humphries at Club Zanzibar, Larry Levan, who was resident DJ at the Paradise Garage from 1977 to 1987, Todd Terry, Kerri Chandler, Masters at Work, Junior Vasquez, and others.[104] In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrells created the \"New York Underground\" sound of house, and they did more than 30 releases on this label featuring this sound. The emergence of New York's DJ and producer Todd Terry in 1988 demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach to a new and commercially successful house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \"Weekend\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines.[105] House was also being developed by DJs and record producers in the booming dance club scene in Ibiza, notably when DJ Alfredo, the father of Balearic house, began his residency at Amnesia in 1983. [when?] While", "<4-hop>\n\nor hardcore techno from the Netherlands, this was associated with the \"rebel\", underground club subculture of the time. Towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, French DJ/producers such as Daft Punk, Bob Sinclar, Stardust, Cassius, St. Germain and DJ Falcon began producing a new sound in Paris' club scene. Together, they laid the groundwork for what would be known as the French house movement. They combined the harder-edged-yet-soulful philosophy of Chicago house with the melodies of obscure funk records. By using new digital production techniques blended with the retro sound of old-school analog synthesizers, they created a new sound and style that influenced house music around the world.[118] Afro house (ostensibly or was also simply referred to as 'house' before being categorized or titled as an official sub-genre)[119] was emerging in South Africa, during or slightly before this period according to various natives especially due to seemingly the emergence simultaneously during or shortly after kwaito and was being popularized globally in various locations such as in the United States.[120][121] Former, kwaito artists such as Oskido and DJ Tira are also associated with, the genre.[120][122] Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley proclaimed 10 August 2005, to be \"House Unity Day\" in Chicago, in celebration of the \"21st anniversary of house music\" (actually the 21st anniversary of the founding of Trax Records, an independent Chicago-based house label). The proclamation recognized Chicago as the original home of house music and that the music's original creators \"were inspired by the love of their city, with the dream that someday their music would spread a message of peace and unity throughout the world\". DJs such as Frankie Knuckles, Marshall Jefferson, Paul Johnson, and Mickey Oliver celebrated the proclamation at the Summer Dance Series, an event organized by Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs.[123] It was during this decade that vocal house became firmly established, both in the underground and as part of the pop market, and labels such as Defected Records, Roulé, and Om were at the forefront of the emerging sound. In the mid-2000s, fusion genres such as electro house and fidget house emerged.[citation needed] This fusion is apparent in the crossover of musical styles by artists such as Dennis Ferrer and Booka Shade, with the former's production style having evolved from the New York soulful house scene and the latter's roots in techno. Numerous live performance events dedicated to house music were founded during the course of the decade, including Shambhala Music Festival and major industry sponsored events like Miami's Winter Music Conference. The genre even gained popularity through events like Creamfields. In the late 2000s, house style witnessed renewed chart success thanks to acts such as Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Fedde Le Grand, David Guetta, and Calvin Harris.[citation needed] Afro house increased in popularity in other regions such as London and the genre's solidified emergence accelerated, resulting in it becoming preeminent, it also appeared to have been attributed to \"giving rise to\" the UK funky, scene.[124] During the 2010s, multiple new sounds in house music were developed by DJs, producers, and artists. Sweden pioneered the \"Mainstage progressive house\" genre with the emergence of Sebastian Ingrosso, Axwell, and Steve Angello. While all three artists had solo careers, when they formed a trio called Swedish House Mafia, it showed that house could still produce chart-topping hits, such as their 2012 single \"Don't You Worry Child\", which cracked the Billboard top 10. Avicii was a Swedish DJ/artist known for his hits such as \"Hey Brother\", \"Wake Me Up\", \"Addicted to You\", \"The Days\", \"The Nights\", \"Levels\", \"Waiting for Love\", \"Without You\", and \"I Could Be the One\" with Nicky Romero. Fellow Swedish DJ/artist Alesso collaborated with Calvin Harris, Usher, and David Guetta.[125] In France, Justice blended garage and alternative rock influences into their pop-infused house tracks, creating a big and funky sound. During the 2010s, in the UK and in the US, many records labels stayed true to the original house music sound from the 1980s. It includes labels like Dynamic Music, Defected Records, Dirtybird, Fuse London, Exploited, Pampa, Cajual Records, Hot Creations, Get Physical, and Pets Recordings.[126] From the Netherlands coalesced the concept of \"Dirty Dutch\", an electro house subgenre characterized by abrasive lead synths and darker arpeggios, with prominent DJs being Chuckie, Hardwell, Laidback Luke, Afrojack, R3hab, Bingo Players, Quintino, and Alvaro. Elsewhere, fusion genres derivative of 2000s progressive house returned, especially with the help of DJs/artists Calvin Harris, David Guetta, Zedd, Eric Prydz, Mat Zo, Above & Beyond, and Fonzerelli in Europe.[127] Diplo, a DJ/producer from Tupelo, Mississippi, blended underground sounds with mainstream styles. As he came from the southern US, Diplo fused house music with rap and dance/pop, while also integrating more obscure southern US genres. Other North Americans playing house music include the Canadian Deadmau5 (known for his unusual mask and unique musical style), Kaskade, Steve Aoki, Porter Robinson, and Wolfgang Gartner. The growing popularity of such artists led to the emergence of electro house and progressive house sounds in popular music, such as singles like David Guetta feat. Avicii's \"Sunshine\"[128] and Axwell's remix of \"In The Air\".[129][130] Big room house became increasingly popular since 2010, through international dance music festivals such as Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival, and Electric Daisy Carnival. In addition to these popular examples of house, there has also been a reunification of contemporary house and its roots. Many hip hop and R&B artists also turned to house music to add a mass appeal and dance floor energy to the music they produce. Tropical house went onto the top 40 on the UK singles Chart in 2015 with artists such as Kygo and Jonas Blue. In the mid-2010s, the influences of house began to also be seen in Korean K-pop music, examples of this being f(x)'s single \"4 Walls\" and SHINee's title track, \"View\". Later in the 2010s, a more traditional house sound came to the forefront of the mainstream in the UK, with Calvin Harris's singles \"One Kiss\" and \"Promises\", with the latter also incorporating elements", "<5-hop>\n\nof nu-disco and Italo house. These singles both went to No.1 in the UK.[131][132] Gqom was developed from kwaito predominantly in Durban, it was popularized globally as artists who popularized and pioneered the genre for instance Babes Wodumo[133] and Distruction Boyz[134] were nominated for the MTV Europe Music Award for Best African Act, collaborated with Major Lazer,[135] featured on the Black Panther (soundtrack)[136] and DJ Lag ,The Lion King: The Gift, album.[137] Afro tech[138] presumably began to initially emerge as artists like Black Coffee for example ostensibly started experimenting with what appeared to be a departed sound, similar to afro house however led by a more techno-like sound.[139] Moreover, seemingly definitely not conventional techno nor deep house such as demonstrated in the song \"We Dance Again\" featuring Nakhane.[139][140][141] The song won the Breakthrough of the Year award at the DJ Awards.[142] The genre is both a sub-genre as well as fusion genre of afro house, there are also opinions that it is \"still\" afro house.[138][124] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,[143][144] one of the South African offshoots of house music, called amapiano, became popular first in South Africa, and then later spread to London and elsewhere worldwide, largely due to online music distribution.[145] Amapiano draws heavily from earlier kwaito house music of South Africa and from jazz and chill-out music.[146] In 2022, the music portal Beatport added an \"amapiano\" genre to its catalogue.[147] During the late 2010s and early 2020s and partially due to YouTube music channels, closely related house subgenres Brazilian bass and slap house became popular worldwide, drawing from deep house and menacing basslines of tech house.[148][149] Fred Again, United Kingdom-born DJ, released a song in 2021 called Marea (We've Lost Dancing) about the pandemic. He wrote this song to express his sadness about losing the house music scene including clubs, music festivals, and being able to dance with one another. This is another example of how COVID-19 affected the house music scene.[150] In 2019, the DJ Awards introduced an additional new Afro house category. Da Capo won the award.[151] In 2020, American singer Lady Gaga released Chromatica, which was her return to her dance roots towards deep house, French house, electro house, and disco house.[152][153] In 2022, Canadian rapper Drake released Honestly, Nevermind, which was a departure from his signature hip hop, R&B, and trap music sound, and moved towards house music and its derivativates: Jersey club,[154][155] and ballroom.[156] South African, artist Black Coffee and German music producers, collective Keinemusik(Crue/Kloud) were amongst the list of co-producers on the album.[157] American singer Beyoncé's album Renaissance, also released in 2022, incorporated ballroom house and gqom.[158]"], "reference": "Early house lyrics generally contained positive, uplifting messages, but spoke especially to those who were considered to be outsiders, especially African Americans, Latinos, and the gay subculture. The house music dance scene was one of the most integrated and progressive spaces in the 1980s; the black and gay populations, as well as other minority groups, were able to dance together in a positive environment. Some house lyrics contained messages calling for equality, unity, and freedom of expression beyond racial or sexual differences.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer"}

Daniel Nakamura, aka Dan the Automator, released two albums that were heavily inspired by trip hop.

British producer Fatboy Slim's breakthrough album, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars,[71] was his most commercially successful release.[importance of example(s)?] Another heavily trip-hop influenced band, Elsiane, published their first album Hybrid in 2007, creating a \"mellow, hypnotic atmosphere utilized in the ’90s by big names like Massive Attack, Portishead, etc.\"[72] Major notable trip hop releases from 2010s include Massive Attack's Heligoland, their first studio album in seven years; and Dutch's A Bright Cold Day in 2010, the latter group including Jedi Mind Tricks producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind.[73][74] DJ Shadow's The Less You Know, the Better was released in 2011 after a highly publicised unveiling of songs, including appearances on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show and previews at a performance in Antwerp in August 2010.[75] The album was met with \"generally favorable reviews\" on Metacritic, with some criticising Shadow's lack of originality. Sam Richards of NME felt that the album sounded \"like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place.\" Beak's album titled Beak>> was released in 2012 and received high scores from journalists, including an 8/10 from NME and Spin magazine.[76] Lana Del Rey released her second album, Born to Die in 2012, which contained a string of trip hop ballads.[77] The album topped the charts in eleven countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom; it has sold 3.4 million copies worldwide as of 2013 according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.[78] Following the 2013 release of EP2, the music of FKA Twigs was described in a Pitchfork Magazine article as \"trip hop for a new time\", with \"a menacing undertow reminiscent of Massive Attack's Mezzanine.\"[79] In September 2021, the Sneaker Pimps released the album \"Squaring the Circle\" which had been their first release in over 20 years, featuring Simonne Jones on some of the tracks. The album, while rooted in Trip Hop, had much more of a Pop styling than previous efforts.[80] In April 2024, Irish rock band Fontaines D.C. released \"Starburster\", the lead single from their fourth album Romance. Critics Consequence and Clash described the track as trip hop.[81][82]", "<2-hop>\n\nPopular artists from the 1980s include Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, Whitney Houston, U2, Bruce Springsteen, George Michael, and the Police.[17] Reflecting on changes in the music industry during the 1980s, Robert Christgau later wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990): The '80s were above all a time of international corporatization, as one major after another gave it up to media moguls in Europe and Japan. By 1990, only two of the six dominant American record companies were headquartered in the U.S. Bizzers acted locally while thinking globally in re audiences/markets (will it sell in Germany? Australia? Venezuela? Indonesia now that we've sunk the pirates? the U.S.S.R.?) and artists/suppliers (world music was a concept whose geoeconomic time had come). After a feisty start, independent labels accepted farm-team status that could lead to killings with the bigs. Cross-promotional hookah became the rule—the soundtrack album, the sponsored tour, the golden-oldie commercial, the T-shirt franchise, the video as song ad and pay-for-play programming and commodity fetish. Record executives became fewer impresarios than arbitragers, speculating in abstract bundles of rights whose physical characteristics meant little or nothing to them. Rock was mere music no longer. It was reconceived as intellectual property, as a form of capital itself.[18] According to Christgau, commercial stardom, as measured by music recording sales certifications, replaced artistry as an indication of a musician's significance. \"When art is intellectual property, image and aura subsume aesthetic substance, whatever exactly that is\", he explained. \"When art is the capital, sales interface with aesthetic quality—Thriller's numbers are part of its experience.\"[18] The 1980s saw the reinvention of Michael Jackson, and the worldwide superstardom of Prince, Madonna, and Whitney Houston, who were all among the most successful musicians during this time. Michael Jackson, also with Prince, was the first African American artist to have his music videos in heavy rotation on MTV, with \"Beat It\", and \"Billie Jean\". (Donna Summer placed the first two videos by an African American female artist, with \"She Works Hard for the Money\" and \"Unconditional Love\", both in 1983.) Jackson's Thriller (1982) is the best-selling album of all time, selling 25 million copies during the decade. The album had sold over 65 million copies. His other album, 1987's Bad, has the honour of being the first album in history to have five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Its accompanying world tour also made history by being the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist in the 1980s, as well as the highest-grossing at the time. In addition to being the biggest-selling artist of the decade, Jackson had nine number-one singles – more than any other artists during the decade – and spent the longest time at number one (27 weeks) in the 1980s. He won numerous awards, including \"Artist of the Decade\" and \"Artist of the Century\", and was arguably the biggest star of the 1980s.[19] Madonna was the best-selling female pop music artist of the decade. Her third studio release, True Blue, became the best-selling female album of the 1980s. Other Madonna albums from the decade include Like a Virgin, one of the best selling albums of all-time, and Like a Prayer (\"As close to art as pop music gets,\" said Rolling Stone). Madonna made music videos a marketing tool and was among the first to make them an art form. Her songs topped several charts, such as: \"Like a Virgin\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"La Isla Bonita\" and \"Like a Prayer\". Madonna was named artist of the decade by several magazines and awards. Whitney Houston was the best-selling female R&B artist of the decade. Her eponymous debut studio album was the best-selling debut album by a solo artist at the time, and her sophomore album Whitney is the first female album to debut at No. 1 in the Billboard 200. She also became the first and only artist to earn seven consecutive number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100, from \"Saving All My Love for You\" in 1985 to \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" in 1988. Her crossover appeal on the popular music charts as well as her prominence on MTV influenced generations of African American artists.[20] Paula Abdul hit it big in 1988. With her debut album Forever Your Girl, she was the first female to have four number-one singles from a debut album (only The Jackson 5 had done the same with their debut).

Daniel Nakamura, aka Dan the Automator, released two albums that were heavily inspired by trip hop. His 2000 album Deltron 3030[69] was a concept album about a rapper from the future, portrayed by Del the Funky Homosapien. 2001 saw the release of his side project, Lovage and the album Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By,[70] with special guests Mike Patton, Prince Paul, Maseo, Damon Albarn, and Afrika Bambaataa. British producer Fatboy Slim's breakthrough album, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars,[71] was his most commercially successful release.[importance of example(s)?] Another heavily trip-hop influenced band, Elsiane, published their first album Hybrid in 2007, creating a \"mellow, hypnotic atmosphere utilized in the ’90s by big names like Massive Attack, Portishead, etc.\"[72] Major notable trip hop releases from 2010s include Massive Attack's Heligoland, their first studio album in seven years; and Dutch's A Bright Cold Day in 2010, the latter group including Jedi Mind Tricks producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind.[73][74] DJ Shadow's The Less You Know, the Better was released in 2011 after a highly publicised unveiling of songs, including appearances on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show and previews at a performance in Antwerp in August 2010.[75] The album was met with \"generally favorable reviews\" on Metacritic, with some criticising Shadow's lack of originality. Sam Richards of NME felt that the album sounded \"like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place.\" Beak's album titled Beak>> was released in 2012 and received high scores from journalists, including an 8/10 from NME and Spin magazine.[76] Lana Del Rey released her second album, Born to Die in 2012, which contained a string of trip hop ballads.[77] The album topped the charts in eleven countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom; it has sold 3.4 million copies worldwide as of 2013 according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.[78] Following the 2013 release of EP2, the music of FKA Twigs was described in a Pitchfork Magazine article as \"trip hop for a new time\", with \"a menacing undertow reminiscent of Massive Attack's Mezzanine.\"[79] In September 2021, the Sneaker Pimps released the album \"Squaring the Circle\" which had been their first release in over 20 years, featuring Simonne Jones on some of the tracks. The album, while rooted in Trip Hop, had much more of a Pop styling than previous efforts.[80] In April 2024, Irish rock band Fontaines D.C. released \"Starburster\", the lead single from their fourth album Romance. Critics Consequence and Clash described the track as trip hop.[81][82]", "<2-hop>\n\nProminent American urban pop acts of the 1980s include Tina Turner, Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan, and Diana Ross. African-American artists like Lionel Richie and Prince became some of the decade's biggest stars. Their hit albums included 1999, Purple Rain, and Sign o' the Times by Prince and Lionel Richie, Can't Slow Down, and Dancing on the Ceiling by Richie. Prince was one of the decade's most prolific artists. He was responsible for artists such as Vanity 6, for whom he wrote the dance chart-topping \"Nasty Girl\"; Morris Day and The Time, for whom he wrote the top 20 \"Jungle Love\"; Sheila E., for whom he wrote the top ten songs \"The Glamorous Life\" and number 11 \"A Love Bizarre\"; and Wendy & Lisa and Apollonia 6. He wrote \"I Feel for You\" for Chaka Khan, which won him a Grammy for best R&B song; \"Sugar Walls\" for Sheena Easton; and as well as doing a duet with \"U Got the Look\", he wrote \"Manic Monday\", a number two pop hit for The Bangles. Artists that covered his music included Tom Jones, who brought his version of the song \"Kiss\" into the top 40 for the second time in the decade. Melissa Morgan brought her cover of \"Do Me, Baby\" to the top of the R&B charts in 1986. Other notable artists that covered Prince during the 1980s were The Pointer Sisters and Cyndi Lauper.[21] He also won an Academy Award for the song \"Purple Rain\". In 1989, Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor recorded a cover of his song \"Nothing Compares 2 U\", which would become the biggest song of the year worldwide in the new decade to follow. Prince had four number-one singles and 14 top-ten hits on the Hot 100 Chart. Lionel Richie teamed with Diana Ross to record one of the decade's biggest hits \"Endless Love\", which topped the Billboard charts for nine weeks. Other songs by Richie, such as \"All Night Long\" and \"Hello\" also topped the charts, and he would have a total of five number one hits and thirteen top ten singles. Diana Ross brought \"Upside Down\" to the top spot in 1980; she would have two number-one singles and eight top ten hits in the decade. Tina Turner topped the charts with \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and scored a total of six top ten singles. Donna Summer's \"She Works Hard for the Money\" was a continuation of the feminist movement started in the 70s and a rallying cry for those who worked hard and wanted to be treated fairly. She would have five top-ten singles in the decade. Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A., AC/DC's Back in Black, Def Leppard's Hysteria, and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet were some of the decade's biggest-selling albums on the Billboard Top 200 chart. During the mid-1980s American pop singer Cyndi Lauper was considered[by whom?] the \"Voice of the MTV Generation of '80s\" and so different visual style that made the world for teens. Her first two albums She's So Unusual (1984) and True Colors (1986) were critically and commercially successful, spawning the hits, \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", \"Time After Time\", \"She Bop\", \"All Through the Night\", \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\", \"True Colors\" and \"Change of Heart\". Several British artists made the successful transition to pop during the 1980s and saw great commercial success, such as David Bowie, Phil Collins, John Lennon, Billy Ocean, Sheena Easton and Paul McCartney. Many British pop bands also dominated the American charts in the early 1980s. Many of them became popular due to their constant exposure on MTV, these bands included The Human League, Culture Club, Duran Duran, and Wham!. Between the four, they have had 9 U.S. number ones with hits like \"Don't You Want Me\", \"Karma Chameleon\", \"The Reflex\" and \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\". In the later part of the decade, Rick Astley, George Michael as a solo artist, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Fine Young Cannibals all found chart success. At the beginning of the 1980s, Australian artists like Olivia Newton-John, Men at Work, Air Supply, and AC/DC all had chart success, later in the decade INXS and Crowded House scored hits. Olivia Newton-John's hit \"Physical\" would top the Hot 100 for 10 weeks and be the decade's biggest hit in the US; she would have six top ten singles during the 80s. Canadian artists such as Men Without Hats, Bryan Adams, and Corey Hart achieved huge success during the decade. American artists such as Blondie, Christopher Cross, Steve Perry, Toni Basil, Michael Sembello, Matthew Wilder, Kim Carnes, Devo, Karla Bonoff, The Weather Girls, Ray Parker Jr., Billy Crystal, Eddie Money, Don Johnson, Bruce Willis, Bobby McFerrin, The B-52's, and Eddie Murphy also had at least one big hit. American artists such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Kool & the Gang, The Pointer Sisters, Huey Lewis and the News, Billy Joel, Hall & Oates, Prince, The Go-Go's, Kenny Rogers and John Mellencamp, then known as John Cougar, ruled the charts throughout the decade in the US. Jackson, Houston, Prince, Madonna, Joel and Springsteen along with U2, Dire Straits, Phil Collins, The Police, Queen, The Rolling Stones and Eurythmics achieved tremendous success worldwide.[22]"], "reference": "Yes, Prince Paul was a special guest on Dan the Automator's side project, Lovage, on the album Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By, released in 2001.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "Who coined the term trip hop, and how did DJ Shadow's work, specifically \\\"In/Flux,\\\" contribute to the definition of the genre?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nfrom the Wild Bunch era. In the June 1994 issue of the UK magazine Mixmag, music journalist Andy Pemberton used the term trip hop to describe the hip hop instrumental \"In/Flux\", a 1993 single by San Francisco's DJ Shadow, and other similar tracks released on the Mo' Wax label and being played in London clubs at the time. \"In/Flux\", with its mixed up bpms, spoken word samples, strings, melodies, bizarre noises, prominent bass, and slow beats, gave the listener the impression they were on a musical trip, according to Pemberton.[34] Soon, however, Massive Attack's dubby, jazzy, psychedelic, electronic textures, rooted in hip hop sampling technique but taking flight into many styles, were described by journalists as the template of the eponymous genre. In 1993, Icelandic musician Björk released Debut, produced by Wild Bunch member Nellee Hooper.[35] The album, although rooted in four-on-the-floor house music, contained elements of trip hop and is credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop.[36][37] She had been in contact with London's underground electronic music scene and was romantically involved with trip-hop musician Tricky. Björk further embraced trip-hop with her 1995 album Post by collaborating with Tricky and Howie B. Homogenic, her 1997 album, has been described as a pinnacle of trip hop music.[38] Trip-hop neared the peak of its popularity in 1994 and 1995, with artists such as Howie B and Earthling making significant contributions. Ninja Tune, the independent record label founded by the duo Coldcut, significantly influenced the trip-hop sound in London and beyond with breakthrough artists DJ Food, 9 Lazy 9, Up, Bustle & Out, Funki Porcini and The Herbaliser, among others. The period also marked the debut of two acts who, along with Massive Attack, would define the Bristol scene for years to come. In 1994, Portishead, a trio comprising singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released their debut album Dummy. Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs.[39] Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year,[40] giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music was also widely imitated, to the point that they distanced themselves[41] from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize, with Barrow stating \"The whole trip-hop tag was nonsense. It was developed by people in London, and the people in Bristol just had to put up with it.\".[42] Tricky also released his debut solo album, Maxinquaye in 1995, to great critical acclaim. The album was produced largely in collaboration with Mark Saunders. Tricky employed whispered, often abstract stream-of-consciousness lyrics, remote from the gangsta-rap braggadocio of the mid-1990s US hip-hop scene. Even more unusually, many of the solo songs on Maxinquaye featured little of Tricky's own voice: his then-lover, Martina Topley-Bird, sang them, including her re-imagining of rap group Public Enemy's 1988 song \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\", while other songs were male-female duets dealing with sex and love in oblique ways, over beds of sometimes dissonant samples. Within a year, Tricky had released two more full-length albums, although they failed to find the same popularity as his Bristol contemporaries Massive Attack and Portishead.[43] Through his collaborations with Björk, however, he exerted influence closer to the pop and alternative rock mainstream, and he developed a large cult fan-base. Although not as popular in the United States, bands like Portishead and Sneaker Pimps saw moderate airplay on alternative-rock stations across the country.[44] After the initial success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, the artists who made their own interpretations of the genre include Archive, Baby Fox, Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Anomie Belle,[48] Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists incorporated trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed use of the term \"post-trip hop\" was in an October 2002 article of The Independent, and was used to describe the band Second Person.[49] Trip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, PJ Harvey,[50] How to Destroy Angels,[51] Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, Bitter:Sweet, Beck, Alanis Morissette, The xx and Deftones.[52] Several tracks on Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue's 1997 album Impossible Princess also displayed a trip hop influence.[53][importance of example(s)?] Various prominent artists and groups, such as Janet Jackson,[54] Kylie Minogue,[55] Madonna,[56][57] Björk,[58][59][60] and Radiohead,[61] have also been influenced by the genre. Trip hop has spawned several subgenres,[62] including illbient (dub-based trip hop which combines ambient and industrial hip hop). Trip hop continued to influence notable artists in the 2000s. Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver incorporated trip hop in their ambient/electronic/jazzy album Perdition City. Atmospheric rock band Antimatter included some trip hop elements in their first two albums. Australian composer Rob Dougan proposed a mix of trip hop beats, orchestral music and electronics. RJD2 began his career as a DJ, but in 2001, began releasing albums under El-P's Def Jux Label.[63] Zero 7's album Simple Things, and in particular, its lead single \"Destiny\", was regarded highly by underground listeners and achieved significant popularity.[64] In 2006, Gotye debuted his second studio album, Like Drawing Blood. The songs on the album featured down-tempo hip-hop beats and dub style bass reminiscent of trip hop.[65] Hip hop groups Zion I and the Dub Pistols also displayed heavy trip hop influence.[66][67] Norwegian singer and songwriter Kate Havnevik is a classically trained musician, but also incorporates trip hop into her work.[68] During the late 1990s and early 2000s trip hop achieved crossover success in the United States, often lumped under the \"electronica\" label. Trip hop songs were featured in film soundtracks of this era such as the Matrix series.", "<2-hop>\n\nTrip hop is a musical genre that originated in the late 1980s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol, England.[3] It has been described as a psychedelic fusion of hip hop and electronica with slow tempos and an atmospheric sound,[4][5][6] often incorporating elements of jazz, soul, funk, reggae, dub, R&B, and other genres, typically of electronic music, as well as sampling from movie soundtracks and other eclectic sources.[7] The style emerged as a more experimental variant of breakbeat from the Bristol sound scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s,[8] incorporating influences from jazz, soul, funk, dub, and rap music.[9] It was pioneered by acts like Massive Attack, UNKLE, Tricky, and Portishead.[10] The term was first coined in a 1994 Mixmag piece about American producer DJ Shadow.[11] Trip hop achieved commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as \"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\".[8] Common musical aesthetics include a bass-heavy drumbeat,[12] often providing the slowed down breakbeat samples similar to standard 1990s hip hop beats, giving the genre a more psychedelic and mainstream feel.[12] Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&B, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&B, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack[13] and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird,[14] and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps.[15] Trip hop is also known for its melancholic sound. This may be partly due to the fact that several acts were inspired by post-punk bands;[16] Tricky and Massive Attack both covered and sampled songs of Siouxsie and the Banshees[17][18] and the Cure.[19][20] Tricky opened his second album Nearly God with a version of \"Tattoo\", a proto-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees initially recorded in 1983.[21] Trip hop tracks often incorporate Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments such as the theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop differs from hip hop in theme and overall tone. Contrasting with gangsta rap and its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural atmospherics influenced by experimental folk and rock acts of the seventies, such as John Martyn,[22] combined with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop may be said to \"transcend\" the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo.[23] The term \"trip-hop\" first appeared in print in June 1994.[11] Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, used it to describe \"In/Flux\", a single by American producer DJ Shadow and UK act RPM, with the latter signed to Mo' Wax Records.[24][25] In Bristol, hip hop began to seep into the consciousness of a subculture already well-schooled in Jamaican forms of music. DJs, MCs, b-boys and graffiti artists grouped together into informal soundsystems.[26] Like the pioneering Bronx crews of DJs Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash, the soundsystems provided party music for public spaces, often in the economically deprived council estates from which some of their members originated. Bristol's soundsystem DJs, drawing heavily on Jamaican dub music, typically used a laid-back, slow and heavy drum beat (\"down tempo\"). Bristol's Wild Bunch crew became one of the soundsystems to put a local spin on the international phenomenon, helping to birth Bristol's signature sound of trip hop, often termed \"the Bristol Sound\".[26] The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence, DJ Milo (Milo Johnson, aka DJ Nature) founding member of the Wild Bunch and the person generally accepted as the creator of the Bristol sound and therefore, trip-hop; MC Adrian \"Tricky Kid\" Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles and Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s,[27] the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack,[28] a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists.[28] Another influence came from Gary Clail's Tackhead soundsystem. Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart.[29] The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart & the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label.[30] Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a premature version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released \"Angel\", one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s. Massive Attack's first album Blue Lines was released in 1991 to huge success in the United Kingdom.[32] Blue Lines was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album's hit single \"Unfinished Sympathy\" and other tracks were not seen as hip hop songs in a conventional sense despite similarities in production methods such as using sample-based rhythms. Co-produced by Jonny Dollar, the orchestral \"Unfinished\" featured R&B singer Shara Nelson, and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack's career.[33] Massive Attack released their second album entitled Protection in 1994. Although Tricky stayed on in a lesser role and Hooper again produced, the fertile dance music scene of the early 1990s had informed the record, and it was seen as an even more significant shift away"], "reference": "The term trip hop was coined by Andy Pemberton in a 1994 Mixmag article.

The 1980s saw the emergence of electronic dance music and indie pop.[1][2][3][4] As disco and new wave fell out of fashion in the decade's early years,[5][6][7][8] genres such as post-disco, Italo disco, Euro disco, and dance-pop became more popular. Rock music continued to enjoy a wide audience.[9] Soft rock,[10] glam metal, thrash metal, shred guitar characterized by heavy distortion, pinch harmonics, and whammy bar abuse became very popular.[11] Adult contemporary,[12] quiet storm,[13] and smooth jazz gained popularity. In the late 1980s, glam metal became the largest, most commercially successful brand of music worldwide.[14] The 1980s are commonly remembered for a great increase in the use of digital recording, associated with the usage of synthesizers, with synth-pop music and other electronic genres featuring non-traditional instruments increasing in popularity. Also during this decade, several major electronic genres were developed, including electro, techno, house, freestyle, and Eurodance, rising in prominence during the 1990s and beyond. Throughout the decade, R&B, hip hop, and urban genres were becoming commonplace, particularly in the inner-city areas of large, metropolitan cities; rap was especially successful in the latter part of the decade,[15] with the advent of the golden age of hip hop. These urban genres—particularly rap and hip hop—would continue their rise in popularity through the 1990s and 2000s.
