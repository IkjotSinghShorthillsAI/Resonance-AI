{"user_input": "I'm looking for new sounds. What's \"Caberet Voltayre\" and how does it fit into the industrial music scene?", "reference_contexts": ["Industrial music is a form of experimental music which emerged in the 1970s. In the 1980s, industrial splintered into a range of offshoots, sometimes collectively named post-industrial music.[1] This list details some of these offshoots, including fusions with other experimental and electronic music genres as well as rock, folk, heavy metal and hip hop. Industrial genres have spread worldwide and are particularly well represented in North America, Europe, and Japan. Industrial music comprises many styles of experimental music, including many forms of electronic music. The term was coined in the mid-1970s for Industrial Records artists. The first industrial artists experimented with noise and controversial topics. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms.[2] Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Boyd Rice, SPK, and Z'EV.[2] Test Dept,[3] Clock DVA,[4] Nocturnal Emissions,[5] Laibach,[6] and The Leather Nun[7] subsequently participated in the movement. German group Einstürzende Neubauten forged their own style, which mixed metal percussion, guitars and unconventional instruments (such as jackhammers and bones) in stage performances that often damaged the venues in which they played.[8] Dark ambient projects like Coil,[9] Lilith,[10] Nurse with Wound,[11] Lustmord,[12] and Zoviet France,[13] evolved out of industrial music during the 1980s. These artists make use of non-musical material and noise, but less abrasively than other post-industrial musicians, bordering more on ambient music.[14] The last material that Throbbing Gristle recorded in the studio, In the Shadow of the Sun and Journey Through a Body, was ambient, and pointed in the direction that TG's offshoots (notably Coil, Chris & Cosey) would take.[15] Other artists include Long Distance Poison,[16] Hafler Trio,[17] MRT, Kim Cascone,[18] Controlled Bleeding,[19] Nine Inch Nails (on their album Ghosts I–IV),[20] early Techno Animal,[21] prominent game music composer Akira Yamaoka, Robin Rimbaud,[22] Final[23] and Deutsch Nepal.[24] Electro-Industrial draws on Electronic Body Music ( EBM), and developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy,[25] Front Line Assembly, and Wumpscut. In the mid-'90s, the style spawned the dark electro and aggrotech offshoots.[26] Other artists include Haujobb,[27] Lab Report,[28] and Leæther Strip.[29] EBM combines elements of European industrial,[30] German electronic music such as that of Klaus Schulze,[31] music of the Neue Deutsche Welle electropunk scene.[31] It first came to prominence in Belgium.[32] The name was coined by Ralf Hütter of Kraftwerk in 1978 to explain the more physical sound of their album The Man-Machine.[33][34] The term was later used in its current sense by Belgian group Front 242 in 1984 to describe their EP No Comment, released in the same year.[35] It denotes a certain type of danceable electronic music, a mixture of electropunk and industrial music. Other artists include Armageddon Dildos,[36][37] Die Krupps,[38] à;GRUMH...,[39] A Split-Second,[40] And One,[41] Bigod 20,[42] The Neon Judgement,[43] and Attrition.[44] Industrial hip hop fuses the themes and aesthetics of industrial with hip hop music. Its origins are in the work of Mark Stewart and Adrian Sherwood. In 1985, Stewart, former Pop Group singer, released As the Veneer of Democracy Starts to Fade, applying the cut-up style of industrial music with the house band of Sugar Hill Records (Doug Wimbish, Keith Leblanc, and Skip McDonald).[45] Sherwood was a major figure in British dub music, as well as working with industrial groups such as Cabaret Voltaire, Einstürzende Neubauten, Ministry, KMFDM, and Nine Inch Nails.[46] Tackhead, a collaboration between Sherwood and the Sugar Hill band, picked up where Stewart left off.[47] The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, from San Francisco,[48][49] and Meat Beat Manifesto,[50] from the UK, are also early representatives of the style. The later work of Broadrick's Godflesh,[51] as well as his collaborations with Kevin Martin, Ice,[52] and Techno Animal,[51] are examples of industrial hip hop.[53] Saul Williams, a slam poet, also performs in the style.[54] Other notable contributors include clipping., B L A C K I E, Death Grips, JPEGMafia, and Dälek."], "reference": "Cabaret Voltaire is listed as a prominent industrial musician.

{"user_input": "Within the context of early industrial and post-punk music, can you tell me about Chrome?", "reference_contexts": ["Industrial rock artists generally employ the basic rock instrumentation of electric guitars, drums and bass and pair it with white noise blasts, electronic music gear (synthesizers, sequencers, samplers and drum machines). Guitars are commonly heavily distorted or otherwise effected. Bass guitars and drums may be played live, or be replaced by electronic musical instruments or computers. The early fusions of industrial music and rock were practiced by a handful of post-punk groups, including Chrome,[55] Killing Joke,[56] Swans,[57]: 32 Big Black,[58] and Foetus.[59] Nine Inch Nails popularized industrial rock in the US with the release of Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral.[60] Industrial metal evolved from the scene, and is practiced by groups such as Ministry,[61] Godflesh,[62] and Fear Factory.[63] Japanoise (a blend of the words \"Japanese\" and \"noise\") is the noise music scene of Japan.[64][65] Popular and active in the 1980s and 1990s but continuing into the early 21st century, the Japanoise scene is defined by its sense of musical freedom: Groups range from the punk demolition of Hanatarash[66] and its subsequent psychedelic Boredoms evolutions,[67] to the tabletop electronics of Incapacitants[68] and Merzbow.[69] The scene was initially inspired by power electronics[70] and sometimes deals with BDSM themes.[71] Nonetheless, Japanoise is often less serious than other post-industrial styles,[72] and some musicians, such as Aube,[73] are also inspired by psychedelia or space rock. Neofolk is the music of artists like Douglas Pearce of Death In June,[74] Tony Wakeford of Sol Invictus,[75] and David Tibet of Current 93,[76] who had collaborated with one another.[77][better source needed] These musicians comprised a post-industrial music circle who incorporated folk music based on traditional European elements. Neofolk can be solely acoustic folk music or a blend of acoustic folk instrumentation with accompanying sounds, such as pianos, strings or elements of industrial music and experimental music. The genre encompasses an assortment of themes including traditional music, heathenry, romanticism and occultism. Neofolk musicians often have ties to other genres such as martial industrial. Apocalyptic folk predates neofolk and was used by David Tibet for the music of his band Current 93 during the late 1980s. Initially, Tibet did not intend to imply connection with the folk music genre; rather, that Current 93's music was made by \"apocalyptic folk, or guys.\"[78] Power electronics was originally coined by William Bennett for the noise music of his own project Whitehouse.[70] It consists of static, screeching waves of feedback, analogue synthesizers making sub-bass pulses or high frequency squealing sounds, and screamed, distorted, often hateful and offensive lyrics. Deeply atonal, there are no conventional melodies or rhythms.[79] Members of Whitehouse who began other projects, such as Sutcliffe Jügend, also practice power electronics.[80] Death industrial is a similar style associated with groups such as The Grey Wolves,[81] but the term first referred to artists such as Brighter Death Now.[82] The Swedish label Cold Meat Industry issued the releases in this subgenre.[82] Power noise (also known as rhythmic noise) takes its inspiration from some of the more structured and distorted early industrial acts, such as Esplendor Geométrico.[83] The Belgian group Dive also anticipated the style in the early '90s.[83][84] Power noise groups meld noise music with various forms of electronic dance music. The term \"power noise\" was coined by Raoul Roucka of Noisex in 1997, with the track \"United (Power Noise Movement)\".[85][86] Typically, power noise is based upon a distorted kick drum from a drum machine such as a Roland TR-909, uses militaristic 4/4 beats, and is usually instrumental. Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is almost always secondary to the rhythm. Power noise tracks are typically structured and danceable, but are occasionally abstract. This genre is showcased at the annual Maschinenfest festival in Krefeld, Germany, as well as at Infest in Bradford, England. Other artists include Imminent Starvation, Axiome, Converter, and Terrorfakt. The German labels Ant-Zen and Hands Productions specialize in the style. Technoid grew out of the scene, taking inspiration from IDM, experimental techno and noise music. German label Hymen Records is responsible for the term and the style.

The best-selling offshoots of industrial music are industrial rock and metal; Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums.[95] Their success led to an increase in commercial success for some other post-industrial musicians; the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down the Spiral, for example, which included contributions from Foetus and Coil, was certified gold in 1996.[95]"], "reference": "Witch house is influenced by hazy 1980s goth bands, including Cocteau Twins.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "I'm looking for some background on Freestyle Fellowship and their impact on hip hop. How did Freestyle Fellowship influence the definition of freestyle in hip hop culture, and what's their significance in the evolution of the art form?", "reference_contexts": ["Freestyle is a style of hip hop music where an artist normally improvises an unwritten verse from the head, with or without instrumental beats, in which lyrics are recited with no particular subject or structure. [1][2][3][4][5] It is similar to other improvisational music, such as jazz,[6] where a lead instrumentalist acts as an improviser with a supporting band providing a beat. Freestyle originally was simply verse that is free of style, written rhymes that do not follow a specific subject matter, or predetermined cadence. The newer style with the improvisation grew popular starting in the early 1990s. It is now mainly associated with hip hop. In the book How to Rap, Big Daddy Kane and Myka 9 note that originally a freestyle was a spit on no particular subject – Big Daddy Kane said, \"in the '80s, when we said we wrote a freestyle rap, that meant that it was a rhyme that you wrote that was free of style... it's basically a rhyme just bragging about yourself.\"[7] Myka 9 adds, \"back in the day, freestyle was bust[ing] a rhyme about any random thing, and it was a written rhyme or something memorized\".[6] Divine Styler says: \"in the school I come from, freestyling was a non-conceptual written rhyme... and now they call freestyling off the top of the head, so the era I come from, it's a lot different\".[8] Kool Moe Dee also refers to this earlier definition in his book, There's A God On The Mic:[9] There are two types of freestyle. There's an old-school freestyle that's basically rhymes that you've written that may not have anything to do with any subject or that goes all over the place. Then there's freestyle where you come off the top of the head.[10] In old school hip-hop, Kool Moe Dee claimed that improvisational rapping was instead called \"coming off the top of the head\",[11] and Big Daddy Kane stated, \"off-the-top-of-the-head [rapping], we just called that 'off the dome' – when you don't write it and [you] say whatever comes to mind\".[7] Referring to this earlier definition (a written rhyme on non-specific subject matter), Big Daddy Kane stated, \"that's really what a freestyle is\"[7] and Kool Moe Dee refers to it as \"true\"[12] freestyle, and \"the real old-school freestyle\".[13] Kool Moe Dee suggests that Kool G Rap's track \"Men At Work\" is an \"excellent example\"[12] of true freestyle, along with Rakim's \"Lyrics of Fury\".[14] Since the early 1990s onwards, with the popularization of improvisational rapping from groups and artists such as Freestyle Fellowship through to fresh fest competitions, \"freestyle\" has come to be the widely used term for rap lyrics that are improvised on the spot.[1][3][4][5] This type of freestyle is the focus of Kevin Fitzgerald's documentary, Freestyle: The Art of Rhyme, where the term is used throughout by numerous artists to mean improvisational rapping.[1] Kool Moe Dee suggests the change in how the term is used happened somewhere in the mid to late 1980s, saying, \"until 1986, all freestyles were written\",[15] and \"before the 1990s, it was about how hard you could come with a written rhyme with no particular subject matter and no real purpose other than showing your lyrical prowess.\"[12] Myka 9 explains that Freestyle Fellowship helped redefine the term – \"that's what they say I helped do – I helped get the world to freestyle, me and the Freestyle Fellowship, by inventing the Freestyle Fellowship and by redefining what freestyle is... We have redefined what freestyle is by saying that it's improvisational rap like a jazz solo\".[6] Although this kind of freestyling is very well respected today,[1] Kool Moe Dee states that this was not the case previously: A lot of the old-school artists didn't even respect what's being called freestyle now...[12] any emcee coming off the top of the head wasn't really respected. The sentiment was emcees only did that if they couldn't write. The coming off the top of the head rhymer had a built-in excuse to not be critiqued as hard.[15] Many rappers learn to rap through improvised freestyling, and by making freestyling into a conversation or a rhyming game which they play frequently as a way to practice, as described in the book How to Rap.[16] Reasons for freestyling include entertainment, as a therapeutic activity, to discover different ways of rapping, promoting oneself, increasing versatility, or as a spiritual activity.[17] Improvised freestyling can also be used in live performances, to do things such as giving something extra to the crowd[18] and to cover up mistakes.[19] To prove that a freestyle is being made up on the spot (as opposed to something pre-written or memorized), rappers will often refer to places and objects in their immediate setting, or will take suggestions on what to rhyme about.[6] Freestyles are performed a cappella,[1] over beatboxing (as seen in Freestyle[1]), or over instrumental versions of songs. Freestyling is often done in a group setting called a \"cypher\" (or \"cipher\") or as part of a \"freestyle battle\".[1] Due to the improvised nature of freestyle, meter and rhythm are usually more relaxed than in conventional rapping. Many artists base their freestyle on their current situation or mental state, but have a ready supply of prepared lyrics and rhyme patterns they can use as filler. Freestyling can also be used as a songwriting method for albums or mixtapes.[20] A freestyle battle is a contest in which two or more rappers or MCs compete or \"battle\" each other using improvised lyrics. It is a prominent part of contemporary Hip Hop culture and originated in the African-American community.[21] In a freestyle battle, each competitor's goal is to \"diss\" their opponent through clever lyrics and wordplay, with heavy emphasis being placed upon the rapper's improvisational ability. Many battles also include metaphorically violent imagery, complementing the \"battling\" atmosphere. It is considered dishonorable or shameful to recite pre-written or memorized raps during a freestyle battle, because it shows the rapper to be incapable of \"spitting\" spur-of-the-moment lyrics. A live audience is key, as a large part"], "reference": "Since the early 1990s onwards, with the popularization of improvisational rapping from groups and artists such as Freestyle Fellowship through to fresh fest competitions, \"freestyle\" has come to be the widely used term for rap lyrics that are improvised on the spot.

Appointed judges may be used in formal contests, but in most cases, the rapper who receives the largest audience response is viewed as the victor. In modern times, with the rise of leagues such as King of the Dot and Ultimate Rap League, most battles are written, with some freestyling incorporated into the verses. This allows for more intricate rhymes and insults. As hip-hop evolved in the early 1980s, many rappers gained their fame through freestyle battles. Battles can take place anywhere: informally on street corners, on stage at a concert, at a school, or at events specifically meant for battling (such as Scribble Jam or the Blaze Battle). A cypher or cipher is an informal gathering of rappers, beatboxers, and/or breakdancers in a circle, in order to jam musically together. The term has also in recent years come to mean the crowd that forms around freestyle battles, consisting of spectators and onlookers. This group serves partly to encourage competition and partly to enhance the communal aspect of rap battles. The cypher is known for \"making or breaking reputations in the Hip Hop community; if you are able to step into the cypher and tell your story, demonstrating your uniqueness, you might be more accepted\".[22] These groups also serve as a way for messages about Hip Hop styles and knowledge to be spread, through word-of-mouth and encouraging trends in other battles.[23] On May 6, 2020, American rapper and slam poet George Watsky, best known for his rapid delivery, set the world record for longest freestyle at 33 hours, 33 minutes and 19 seconds.

The best-selling offshoots of industrial music are industrial rock and metal; Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums.[95] Their success led to an increase in commercial success for some other post-industrial musicians; the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down the Spiral, for example, which included contributions from Foetus and Coil, was certified gold in 1996.[95]"], "reference": "Coil, along with other dark ambient projects like Lilith, Nurse with Wound, Lustmord, and Zoviet France, evolved out of industrial music during the 1980s by utilizing non-musical material and noise in a less abrasive manner, bordering more on ambient music.
