It developed in the early 1980s in Western Europe, as an outgrowth of both the punk and the industrial music cultures.[10] It combines sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed disco rhythms, and mostly undistorted vocals and command-like shouts with confrontational or provocative themes.[9] The evolution of the genre reflected \"a general shift towards more song-oriented structures in industrial as to a general turn towards the dancefloor by many musicians and genres in the era of post-punk.\"[11][12] It was considered a part of the European new wave and post-punk movement and the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style of dancing (e.g. pogo).[13] EBM gained a stable following in the second half of the 1980s.[14] Around that period, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM[15] whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America) as rivetheads.[16] The term electronic body music was first used by Ralf Hütter of the German electronic band Kraftwerk in an interview with British music newspaper Sounds in November 1977.[17] In June 1978 Hütter reused the phrase in an interview with WKSU radio (Kent, Ohio) to explain the more physical character of the Kraftwerk album The Man-Machine.[18] Although the term originated in the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s when it reappeared and started to come into popular use.[19][20] EBM stands for 'electronic body music', a term which only really came into use when the Brits and Belgians stepped into the 'sequencer business' with bands like Nitzer Ebb and Front 242. There you could find that sound again, where it was catchily picked up and labelled. In our days all these terms didn't exist, not 'industrial' nor 'post-punk'. [...] To us it was sequencer music, that was what we did.[19] In 1981, DAF from Germany employed the term \"Körpermusik\" (body music) to describe their danceable electronic punk sound.[21][22] The term \"electronic body music\" was later used by Belgian band Front 242 in 1984[23] to describe the music of their EP of that year titled No Comment.[24][25] Described as an outgrowth of \"electronically generated punk [music] intertwined with industrial sounds,\"[26] EBM has been characterized as a composite of programmed drum beats, repetitive basslines, and clear or slightly distorted vocals, instructional shouts or growls[27] complemented with reverberation and echo effects.[9] Typical EBM rhythms rely on the 4/4 disco beat or rock-oriented backbeats,[8] (featuring kick drum, snare and hi-hat) and some minor syncopation.[28][9] Environmental samples, e.g. hammer blow, machine and alert sounds, are often used to create a \"factory ambiance\". Other samples include political speeches and excerpts from science fiction movies,[9] cf. Front 242 – Funkahdafi.[28] EBM evolved from a combination of post-punk, industrial and post-industrial music sources, including The Normal, Suicide, DAF, Die Krupps, Killing Joke, Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle[9] and Test Dept. but also krautrock and Berlin school[7] artists such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream (who had used electronic bass sequences as a basic feature in their productions).[4][9] The song \"Warm Leatherette\" (The Normal, 1978) stands at the beginning of an important development, the electrified version of Punk that had been picked up and transformed in Düsseldorf by bands like Die Krupps, DAF and Liaisons Dangereuses, music that might be called proto-EBM at least. [...] The role of sequencers, synthesizer and drum machine sounds for the creative process itself and its results are another interesting point concerning EBM. The use of these instruments contributed obviously to the formation of danceable grooves and sound textures that attracted a wider audience.[30] Other influences include the synth-pop music of The Human League and Fad Gadget; and the krautrock-inspired dance hit \"I Feel Love\" by Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer.[31][9] Daniel Bressanutti (Front 242), who helped establish the term EBM, named the soundscapes of Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze as additional influences along Kraftwerk, Throbbing Gristle, the sequencer-based electro-disco of Giorgio Moroder,[32] and the punk movement.[6] Emerging in the early 1980s in Germany and Belgium,[33] bands such as DAF, Die Krupps,[34] Liaisons Dangereuses,[30] and Front 242 started to blend danceable rhythms and repetitive sequencer lines.[35] At the time the genre arose, style-defining synthesizers included Korg MS-20,[35] Roland SH-101,[36] ARP Odyssey,[35] Emulator II,[28] along with several Oberheim and Yamaha models.[35] Archetypical songs are Verschwende deine Jugend, Alle gegen alle and Der Mussolini by DAF; Wahre Arbeit, wahrer Lohn, Goldfinger and Für einen Augenblick by Die Krupps; Etre assis ou danser, Los niños del parque and Avant-après mars by Liaisons Dangereuses, and Body to Body, U-Men and He Runs Too Fast for Us by Front 242. Front 242 characterized their approach as somewhere between Throbbing Gristle and Kraftwerk.[25] Nitzer Ebb and Portion Control, influenced by DAF[37] and Cabaret Voltaire, followed soon after.

North American bands started to use EBM-typical bass sequences and combined them with the roughness of (hardcore) punk and thrash metal (cf. industrial metal). Nine Inch Nails continued the cross-pollination between EBM and rock music[48] resulting in the album Pretty Hate Machine (1989).[9] Meanwhile, EBM became successful in the underground club scene, particularly in Europe.

{"user_input": "Were there any Belgan artists involved in reactivating EBM in the late 1990s?", "reference_contexts": ["album 06:21:03:11 Up Evil by Front 242 initiated the end of the EBM era of the 1980s. Nitzer Ebb, one of the most important purveyors of the genre, turned into an alternative rock band. Without the strength of its figureheads, electronic body music as a discernable music style faded by the mid-1990s.[9] In the late 1990s and after the millennium, Belgian, Swedish and German artists such as Ionic Vision, Tyske Ludder, and Spetsnaz[9] had reactivated the style. Based on this revival, Sweden and East Germany then became the centre of the movement[57] spawning a variety of newcomers. Primarily as a counteracting force against the expanding futurepop scene,[58] these artists followed a neo-traditionalistic path, often referred to as \"old school EBM\".[12] Simultaneously, a number of European techno producers started incorporating elements of EBM into their sound. This tendency grew in parallel with the emerging electroclash scene[9] and, as that scene started to decline, artists partly associated with it, such as The Hacker, DJ Hell,[59] Green Velvet, Black Strobe,[60] and David Carretta, moved towards this techno/EBM crossover style. There has been increasing convergence between this scene and the old school EBM scene. Some artists have remixed each other. Most notably, Terence Fixmer joined with Nitzer Ebb's Douglas McCarthy to form Fixmer/McCarthy.[61] EBM follows the transgressive approach of punk and industrial music (e.g. \"demystification of symbols\"[62]) and the use of provocative extreme imagery is common (e.g. Nazi paraphernalia;[63] reminiscent of punk's use of the swastika[64]).[65] Appropriating totalitarian, Socialist and Fascist references, symbols, and signifiers has been a recurring topic of debate between fans and outsiders to the genre alike due to its stylistical ambiguity that stems from industrial music's contrarian nature.[66] In one instance, military-themed band Laibach \"ma[de] no attempt to subvert this image [so] it has the aura of authenticity\" so \"[m]any Laibach fans began to revel in the evils of the band and to take their stage act at face value.\"[66] Bon and Doug were heavily influenced by DAF, Test Dept. and Einstürzende Neubauten. Hand in hand with the music was the image which unashamedly borrowed a lot from German and Soviet imagery. We all loved the sharp and striking design images of Russian and German '30s and '40s posters and artwork. Obviously we faced a lot of questions and objections about the ‚Neo-Nazi' image. But really we were just using the images to get people to sit up and listen. ‚Iconoclastic minimalism' was one phrase that was used to describe Nitzer Ebb at the time.[67] The military style of EBM has a \"part-human part-machine\" gestalt typical of transhumanist or cyberpunk movements. EBM asserts a hyper-masculine image of \"triumphalism, combat postures, and paranoia,\"[68] and is known for its \"tough-guy\" or machismo attitudes displayed by both men and women.[69] According to Gabi Delgado-López of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, the duo who adopted an aesthetic of black leather and military paraphernalia in the early 1980s was inspired by the male homosexual sado-masochistic scene and is not meant to represent \"machismo ideology\" but part of a \"role.\"[70] Electro-industrial is an outgrowth of the EBM and industrial music that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has minimal structures and a clean production, electro-industrial draws on deep, complex and layered sounds, incorporating elements of ambient industrial. Electro-industrial was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Numb and Mentallo & The Fixer. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the dark electro genre and, in the end of the decade, a strongly techno- and hard-trance-inspired style called \"hellektro\" or \"aggrotech.\" Industrial dance is a North American umbrella term for electronic body music and electro-industrial music. Fans associated with these genres call themselves rivetheads. In general, industrial dance is characterized by its \"electronic beats, symphonic keyboard lines, pile-driver rhythms, angst-ridden or sampled vocals, and cyberpunk imagery\".[71][72] Since the mid-1980s,[73] the term industrial dance has been used to describe the music of Cabaret Voltaire (early 1980s),[74][75] early Die Krupps,[76] Portion Control,[77] The Neon Judgement,[76] Clock DVA,[78] Nitzer Ebb,[79][80] KMFDM,[81][82][83] Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly,[84][85][86] Front 242,[72][76][80][87] Ministry,[88] Nine Inch Nails,[89][88][90] Manufacture,[91] Yeht Mae,[78] My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult,[92] Leæther Strip[93] or early Spahn Ranch.[94] In March 1989, Spin Magazine presented a two-paged special report about the industrial dance movement in Canada and the U.S.[91]"], "reference": "In the late 1990s and after the millennium, Belgian artists such as Ionic Vision reactivated the style.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
{"user_input": "Like, what even *is* Lennie De Ice, innit? I heard they like, did something important for jungle, but like, what did they *do* exactly, yeah?", "reference_contexts": ["Jungle is a genre of electronic music that developed out of the UK rave scene and Jamaican sound system culture in the 1990s. Emerging from breakbeat hardcore, the style is characterised by rapid breakbeats, heavily syncopated percussive loops, samples, and synthesised effects, combined with the deep basslines, melodies, and vocal samples found in dub, reggae and dancehall, as well as hip hop and funk.[1] Many producers frequently sampled the \"Amen break\" or other breakbeats from funk and jazz recordings.[2] Jungle was a direct precursor to the drum and bass genre which emerged in the mid-1990s.[3][4] The breakbeat hardcore scene of the early 1990s was beginning to fragment by 1992 and 1993, with different influences becoming less common together in tracks. The piano and uplifting vocal style that was prevalent in breakbeat hardcore started to lay down the foundations of 4-beat/happy hardcore, whilst tracks with dark-themed samples and industrial-style stabs had emerged from late 1992 and named darkcore. Reggae samples and reggae-influenced tracks had been a feature of many breakbeat hardcore tracks since 1990, particularly from producers such as Shut Up and Dance,[5] however Ibiza Records,[6] and the Rebel MC were arguably the first to bring the sound system influence solidly into releases. The track \"We Are I.E.\" by Lennie De Ice is often credited as being the track that laid down the foundations for jungle with its ragga bassline.[7] The infiltration of hardcore B-boys into the rave scene was catalyst for \"the messy birth-pangs of Britain's very own equivalent to US hip hop: jungle.\"[8] The UK B-boy's removal from American racial tensions made hip-hop's sample and beat-making more attractive than the \"protest side of rap,\" and spurred on their interest in the rave scene.[8] Alongside their 'sampladelic' taste, raving B-boys' use of MDMA fueled the more hyper sound that was passed down to jungle, even after the drug was left for marijuana. During 1992 and 1993, the phrases \"jungle techno\" and \"hardcore jungle\" proliferated to describe that shift of the music from breakbeat hardcore to jungle. The sound was championed at clubs such as AWOL,[9] Roast, and Telepathy, by DJs such as DJ Ron, DJ Hype, DJ Randall, Mickey Finn, DJ Rap, and Kenny Ken, record labels Moving Shadow, V Recordings, Suburban Base, and Renk,[10] and on pirate radio stations such as Kool FM (regarded as being the most instrumental station in the development of jungle) but also Don FM, Rush, and Rude FM. Tracks would span breakbeat styles, particularly with darkcore, with notable releases including \"Darkage\" by DJ Solo, \"Valley of the Shadows\" by Origin Unknown, \"Set Me Free\" by Potential Bad Boy, \"28 Gun Bad Boy\" by A Guy Called Gerald, \"Crackman\" by DJ Ron, \"A London Sumtin\" by Code 071, \"Learning from My Brother\" by Family of Intelligence, \"Lion of Judah\" by X Project, and \"Be Free\" by Noise Factory. Techniques and styles could be traced to such a vast group of influencers, each adding their own little elements. According to Simon Reynolds, jungle was \"Britain's very own equivalent to US hip-hop. That said, you could equally make the case that jungle is a raved-up, digitised offshoot of Jamaican reggae. Musically, jungle's spatialised production, bass quake pressure and battery of extreme sonic effects, make it a sort of postmodern dub music on steroids.\"[11] This is an example of the effects of the sonic diaspora and the wide influence musical genres have; Jungle is where these different Black Atlantic genres converge.[11] Reynolds noted the audience of the genre evolved alongside the music itself; going from a \"sweaty, shirtless white teenager, grinning and gurning\" to a \"head nodding, stylishly dressed black twenty something with hooded-eyes, holding a spliff in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other\".[11] Jungle also served as \"a site for a battle between contesting notions of blackness\".[12] Jungle reached the peak of its popularity between 1994 and 1995. At this stage, the genre was achieving a number of UK top 40 hits, including \"Incredible\" by M-Beat featuring General Levy, and spawned a series of CD compilations such as Jungle Mania and Jungle Hits. Controversy raged over the success of \"Incredible\" when Levy reportedly made comments in the media that he was \"running jungle at the moment\". Although Levy always argued that his comments were misinterpreted, this did not fail to stop a boycott of the single amongst a group of DJs that were dubbed as the \"Jungle Committee\".[13][14] Labels such as Ibiza, 3rd Party and Kemet were prolific in their releases.[15] Having previously been confined to pirate radio, legal stations woke up to jungle from 1994. London's Kiss 100 launched its Givin' It Up show in early 1994 and featured DJs on rotation including Kenny Ken Jumpin Jack Frost, DJ Randall, DJ Rap, and Mickey Finn. A year later, the UK's nationwide broadcaster BBC Radio 1 finally gave jungle a platform on its One in the Jungle weekly show.[16] Major labels such as Sony and BMG were signing deals with artists including A Guy Called Gerald, Kemet, and DJ Ron. Of these, Roni Size and 4hero would achieve wider commercial success as drum and bass artists, but continued to release more underground jungle tracks — the latter adopting the alias Tom & Jerry to continue to release rare groove sampling dancefloor-oriented jungle. The underground classic \"Burial\" by Leviticus would see a major release on FFRR Records. Jungle music, as a scene, was unable to decide whether it wanted to be recognised in the mainstream or if it wanted to avoid misrepresentation.[11] This manifested in the cooperation of jungle artists and small record labels. Small record labels worked to provide more autonomy to the music artists in return for their business and jungle music was proliferated by pirate stations in underground networks and clubs. Whilst the media would in part feed off jungle music success, it also perpetuated negative stereotypes about the scene as being violent. The seminal 1994 documentary A London Some 'Ting Dis, chronicled the growing jungle scene and interviewed producers, DJs,"], "reference": "The track \"We Are I.E.\" by Lennie De Ice is often credited as being the track that laid down the foundations for jungle with its ragga bassline.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}

Hip-hop and jazz-influenced tracks dominated the clubs in this period.[12] Dillinja, Roni Size, Die, Hype, Zinc, Alex Reece and Krust were instrumental in the transition of the jungle sound to drum and bass. By the end of 1998, the genre's sound had changed forms significantly from the sound heard earlier in the decade. Ragga jungle is a fusion genre that combines jungle with a heavy reggae influence. It would become a major subgenre during 1994 and 1995, with popular tracks such as \"Incredible\" by M-Beat featuring General Levy, \"Original Nuttah\" by UK Apachi and Shy FX, \"Sound Murderer / RIP\" by Remarc, \"Limb by Limb\" by Hitman featuring Cutty Ranks, and \"Code Red / Champion DJ\" by Conquering Lion.[19] In 1995, jump-up would also become a popular subgenre that came out of hardstep, with influences of various kinds of sound experiments, most importantly the bass line. Popular tracks of this subgenre include \"Dred Bass\" by Dead Dred, \"Super Sharp Shooter\" by DJ Zinc, \"This Style\" by Shy FX, \"R.I.P\" (DJ Hype Remix) by Remarc and DJ Zinc's remix of the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\". The genre would later regain popularity in the early 2000s with new productions by artists such as Shimon & Andy C, Bad Company, DJ Hazard and Pendulum.[20] The post-Thatcherite United Kingdom of the early 1990s had left many young people, particularly London's lower-class urban youth, disenfranchised and disillusioned with a seemingly crumbling societal structure. Jungle reflected these feelings, as it was a notably more dark, less euphoric style of music than many of the other styles popular at raves. The music was much more popular with black British youths than other rave styles, such as techno, even though it was heavily influenced by these other rave styles, including those from the United States.[11] Jungle music was also seen as \"England's answer to hip-hop\", aimed at breaking down racial boundaries and promoting unification through its multiculturalism by drawing from different cultures and attracting mixed crowds at raves.[12] Jungle's rhythm-as-melody style overturned the dominance of melody-over-rhythm in the hierarchy of Western music, adding to its radical nature.[11] Moreover, the greater accessibility to sampling technology allowed young people to create music in their homes by incorporating their own sampling and experiences, rather than needing a grand recording studio.[21] Characterised by the breakbeats and multi-tiered rhythms, Jungle drew support not only from British b-boys who got swept up into the rave scene, but also from reggae, dancehall, electro and rap fans alike. Simon Reynolds described it as causing fear and \"for many ravers, too funky to dance\"[11] yet the club scene enjoyed every second. The origin of the word jungle is one of discussion. Rebel MC is often noted for having popularised the term, and in Simon Reynolds' book Energy Flash, MC Navigator is quoted as attributing the word to him.[22] Others such as MC Five-O attribute it to MC Moose,[23] whilst Rob Playford (of Moving Shadow) attributes it to MC Mad P (of Top Buzz).[24] Some thought of this term as empowering, an assertion of the blackness of the music and its subculture, inverting the racist history of the term \"jungle music\".[12] Notable releases include: \"Burial\" by Leviticus, \"Dangerous\" by DJ Ron, \"Lover to Lover / Maximum Style\" by Tom & Jerry, \"Original Nuttah\" by Shy FX, \"All the Crew Big Up\" by Roni Size & DJ Die, \"Incredible / Sweet Love\" by M-Beat, \"The Helicopter Tune\" by Deep Blue, \"Super Sharp Shooter\" by DJ Zinc, \"Sovereign Melody / Lion Heart\" by Dillinja, \"Everyman\" by Kenny Ken, \"The Victory / Lovable\" by DJ Dextrous, \"Bad Ass\" by Aphrodite, \"The Lighter\" by DJ SS, and \"Tiger Style\" by DJ Hype.[25][26][27][28] The term \"jungle\" is often used as a synonym for drum and bass, particularly in the United States. More commonly, jungle is viewed as the originating point for drum and bass, with the progressive changes brought by artists in the late 1990s serving as the point of diversion (some examples being Trace & Ed Rush, LTJ Bukem, Photek, Total Science, Goldie and Optical). During this time, a false dichotomy was established between drum and bass and jungle, with the former for white ravers and the latter for black ravers.[29] The sub-genre of drum and bass developed to be quicker, more industrial, less danceable yet was seen as more 'accessible and commercial' than jungle, as cited in an article by The Observer in 1996.[30] In Black Music in Britain in the 21st Century, written by Julia Toppin in 2023, she explains, \"the process of modifying jungle's name can be viewed as an 'act of resignifying the otherness' to disassociate it from black people and the racist media narratives containing race, drugs, and violence with jungle music and the scene.\"[31] The jungle scene had always been portrayed in a negative light due to its affiliation with the rave scene and especially because of the black people associated with the music.[32] The security and drug incidents at jungle events typically seemed to attract more police attention than other EDM genres, though the same trouble would happen in any other raves attended by predominately white audiences. With the emergence of drum and bass, the previous biases against jungle intensified while drum and bass's popularity grew rapidly in mainstream media. In her article, Toppin highlights the sonic marginalization that occurred during the late 1990s, with black jungle ravers declined entry at night clubs and DJs being shadow-banned from playing jungle at venues.[33] This would lead to jungle's return to the underground at the end of the decade. A thriving underground movement producing and developing tracks in the style of the 1990s and some original (though mostly mainstream drum and bass) jungle producers have noticed this new enthusiasm for the original sound. Shy FX, for example, launched the Digital Soundboy label in 2005 to put out more jungle.

Without the strength of its figureheads, electronic body music as a discernable music style faded by the mid-1990s.[9] In the late 1990s and after the millennium, Belgian, Swedish and German artists such as Ionic Vision, Tyske Ludder, and Spetsnaz[9] had reactivated the style. Based on this revival, Sweden and East Germany then became the centre of the movement[57] spawning a variety of newcomers. Primarily as a counteracting force against the expanding futurepop scene,[58] these artists followed a neo-traditionalistic path, often referred to as \"old school EBM\".[12] Simultaneously, a number of European techno producers started incorporating elements of EBM into their sound. This tendency grew in parallel with the emerging electroclash scene[9] and, as that scene started to decline, artists partly associated with it, such as The Hacker, DJ Hell,[59] Green Velvet, Black Strobe,[60] and David Carretta, moved towards this techno/EBM crossover style. There has been increasing convergence between this scene and the old school EBM scene. Some artists have remixed each other. Most notably, Terence Fixmer joined with Nitzer Ebb's Douglas McCarthy to form Fixmer/McCarthy.[61] EBM follows the transgressive approach of punk and industrial music (e.g. \"demystification of symbols\"[62]) and the use of provocative extreme imagery is common (e.g. Nazi paraphernalia;[63] reminiscent of punk's use of the swastika[64]).[65] Appropriating totalitarian, Socialist and Fascist references, symbols, and signifiers has been a recurring topic of debate between fans and outsiders to the genre alike due to its stylistical ambiguity that stems from industrial music's contrarian nature.[66] In one instance, military-themed band Laibach \"ma[de] no attempt to subvert this image [so] it has the aura of authenticity\" so \"[m]any Laibach fans began to revel in the evils of the band and to take their stage act at face value.\"[66] Bon and Doug were heavily influenced by DAF, Test Dept. and Einstürzende Neubauten. Hand in hand with the music was the image which unashamedly borrowed a lot from German and Soviet imagery. We all loved the sharp and striking design images of Russian and German '30s and '40s posters and artwork. Obviously we faced a lot of questions and objections about the ‚Neo-Nazi' image. But really we were just using the images to get people to sit up and listen. ‚Iconoclastic minimalism' was one phrase that was used to describe Nitzer Ebb at the time.[67] The military style of EBM has a \"part-human part-machine\" gestalt typical of transhumanist or cyberpunk movements. EBM asserts a hyper-masculine image of \"triumphalism, combat postures, and paranoia,\"[68] and is known for its \"tough-guy\" or machismo attitudes displayed by both men and women.[69] According to Gabi Delgado-López of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, the duo who adopted an aesthetic of black leather and military paraphernalia in the early 1980s was inspired by the male homosexual sado-masochistic scene and is not meant to represent \"machismo ideology\" but part of a \"role.\"[70] Electro-industrial is an outgrowth of the EBM and industrial music that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has minimal structures and a clean production, electro-industrial draws on deep, complex and layered sounds, incorporating elements of ambient industrial. Electro-industrial was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Numb and Mentallo & The Fixer. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the dark electro genre and, in the end of the decade, a strongly techno- and hard-trance-inspired style called \"hellektro\" or \"aggrotech.\" Industrial dance is a North American umbrella term for electronic body music and electro-industrial music. Fans associated with these genres call themselves rivetheads. In general, industrial dance is characterized by its \"electronic beats, symphonic keyboard lines, pile-driver rhythms, angst-ridden or sampled vocals, and cyberpunk imagery\".[71][72] Since the mid-1980s,[73] the term industrial dance has been used to describe the music of Cabaret Voltaire (early 1980s),[74][75] early Die Krupps,[76] Portion Control,[77] The Neon Judgement,[76] Clock DVA,[78] Nitzer Ebb,[79][80] KMFDM,[81][82][83] Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly,[84][85][86] Front 242,[72][76][80][87] Ministry,[88] Nine Inch Nails,[89][88][90] Manufacture,[91] Yeht Mae,[78] My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult,[92] Leæther Strip[93] or early Spahn Ranch.[94] In March 1989, Spin Magazine presented a two-paged special report about the industrial dance movement in Canada and the U.S.[91]"], "reference": "Electronic body music (EBM) combines elements of industrial music and synth-punk with dance music, featuring sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed disco rhythms, and vocals with confrontational themes.

{"user_input": "What are some key characteristics and origins of Electronic body music (EBM) as it relates to Industrial Music?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nElectronic body music (EBM) is a genre of electronic music that combines elements of industrial music and synth-punk with elements of dance music. It developed in the early 1980s in Western Europe, as an outgrowth of both the punk and the industrial music cultures.[10] It combines sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed disco rhythms, and mostly undistorted vocals and command-like shouts with confrontational or provocative themes.[9] The evolution of the genre reflected \"a general shift towards more song-oriented structures in industrial as to a general turn towards the dancefloor by many musicians and genres in the era of post-punk.\"[11][12] It was considered a part of the European new wave and post-punk movement and the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style of dancing (e.g. pogo).[13] EBM gained a stable following in the second half of the 1980s.[14] Around that period, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM[15] whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America) as rivetheads.[16] The term electronic body music was first used by Ralf Hütter of the German electronic band Kraftwerk in an interview with British music newspaper Sounds in November 1977.[17] In June 1978 Hütter reused the phrase in an interview with WKSU radio (Kent, Ohio) to explain the more physical character of the Kraftwerk album The Man-Machine.[18] Although the term originated in the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s when it reappeared and started to come into popular use.[19][20] EBM stands for 'electronic body music', a term which only really came into use when the Brits and Belgians stepped into the 'sequencer business' with bands like Nitzer Ebb and Front 242. There you could find that sound again, where it was catchily picked up and labelled. In our days all these terms didn't exist, not 'industrial' nor 'post-punk'. [...] To us it was sequencer music, that was what we did.[19] In 1981, DAF from Germany employed the term \"Körpermusik\" (body music) to describe their danceable electronic punk sound.[21][22] The term \"electronic body music\" was later used by Belgian band Front 242 in 1984[23] to describe the music of their EP of that year titled No Comment.[24][25] Described as an outgrowth of \"electronically generated punk [music] intertwined with industrial sounds,\"[26] EBM has been characterized as a composite of programmed drum beats, repetitive basslines, and clear or slightly distorted vocals, instructional shouts or growls[27] complemented with reverberation and echo effects.[9] Typical EBM rhythms rely on the 4/4 disco beat or rock-oriented backbeats,[8] (featuring kick drum, snare and hi-hat) and some minor syncopation.[28][9] Environmental samples, e.g. hammer blow, machine and alert sounds, are often used to create a \"factory ambiance\". Other samples include political speeches and excerpts from science fiction movies,[9] cf. Front 242 – Funkahdafi.[28] EBM evolved from a combination of post-punk, industrial and post-industrial music sources, including The Normal, Suicide, DAF, Die Krupps, Killing Joke, Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle[9] and Test Dept. but also krautrock and Berlin school[7] artists such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream (who had used electronic bass sequences as a basic feature in their productions).[4][9] The song \"Warm Leatherette\" (The Normal, 1978) stands at the beginning of an important development, the electrified version of Punk that had been picked up and transformed in Düsseldorf by bands like Die Krupps, DAF and Liaisons Dangereuses, music that might be called proto-EBM at least. [...] The role of sequencers, synthesizer and drum machine sounds for the creative process itself and its results are another interesting point concerning EBM. The use of these instruments contributed obviously to the formation of danceable grooves and sound textures that attracted a wider audience.[30] Other influences include the synth-pop music of The Human League and Fad Gadget; and the krautrock-inspired dance hit \"I Feel Love\" by Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer.[31][9] Daniel Bressanutti (Front 242), who helped establish the term EBM, named the soundscapes of Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze as additional influences along Kraftwerk, Throbbing Gristle, the sequencer-based electro-disco of Giorgio Moroder,[32] and the punk movement.[6] Emerging in the early 1980s in Germany and Belgium,[33] bands such as DAF, Die Krupps,[34] Liaisons Dangereuses,[30] and Front 242 started to blend danceable rhythms and repetitive sequencer lines.[35] At the time the genre arose, style-defining synthesizers included Korg MS-20,[35] Roland SH-101,[36] ARP Odyssey,[35] Emulator II,[28] along with several Oberheim and Yamaha models.[35] Archetypical songs are Verschwende deine Jugend, Alle gegen alle and Der Mussolini by DAF; Wahre Arbeit, wahrer Lohn, Goldfinger and Für einen Augenblick by Die Krupps; Etre assis ou danser, Los niños del parque and Avant-après mars by Liaisons Dangereuses, and Body to Body, U-Men and He Runs Too Fast for Us by Front 242. Front 242 characterized their approach as somewhere between Throbbing Gristle and Kraftwerk.[25] Nitzer Ebb and Portion Control, influenced by DAF[37] and Cabaret Voltaire, followed soon after. Groups from this era often applied socialist realist aesthetics, with ironic intent.[38] Other prominent artists were Pankow,[39] Vomito Negro, Borghesia, The Neon Judgement,[40] à;GRUMH...,[41][9] A Split-Second,[42] The Klinik, and Signal Aout 42.[43] In the second half of the 1980s, the genre became popular in Canada (Front Line Assembly[44]) and the U.S. (Ministry,[45] Revolting Cocks,[46] Schnitt Acht[47])[9] as well as in Sweden (Inside Treatment, Pouppée Fabrikk, Cat Rapes Dog) and Japan (2nd Communication, DRP, Soft Ballet). North American bands started to use EBM-typical bass sequences and combined them with the roughness of (hardcore) punk and thrash metal (cf. industrial metal). Nine Inch Nails continued the cross-pollination between EBM and rock music[48] resulting in the album Pretty Hate Machine (1989).[9] Meanwhile, EBM became successful in the underground club scene, particularly in Europe. In this period the most important labels were the Belgian Play It Again Sam and Antler-Subway, the German Zoth Ommog, the North American Wax Trax! and the Swedish Energy Rekords. Notable acts at that time included And One,[49] Armageddon Dildos,[50] Bigod 20,[51] Insekt,[52] Scapa Flow,[53] Orange Sector,[54] Paranoid,[55] and Electro Assassin.[56] Between the early and mid-1990s, many EBM artists ceased activities or changed their musical direction, incorporating more elements of rock, heavy metal and electronica.

{"user_input": "Considering the development of the jungle music genre out of the UK rave scene, what were some of the key elements that defined it in the 1990s?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nJungle is a genre of electronic music that developed out of the UK rave scene and Jamaican sound system culture in the 1990s. Emerging from breakbeat hardcore, the style is characterised by rapid breakbeats, heavily syncopated percussive loops, samples, and synthesised effects, combined with the deep basslines, melodies, and vocal samples found in dub, reggae and dancehall, as well as hip hop and funk.[1] Many producers frequently sampled the \"Amen break\" or other breakbeats from funk and jazz recordings.[2] Jungle was a direct precursor to the drum and bass genre which emerged in the mid-1990s.[3][4] The breakbeat hardcore scene of the early 1990s was beginning to fragment by 1992 and 1993, with different influences becoming less common together in tracks. The piano and uplifting vocal style that was prevalent in breakbeat hardcore started to lay down the foundations of 4-beat/happy hardcore, whilst tracks with dark-themed samples and industrial-style stabs had emerged from late 1992 and named darkcore. Reggae samples and reggae-influenced tracks had been a feature of many breakbeat hardcore tracks since 1990, particularly from producers such as Shut Up and Dance,[5] however Ibiza Records,[6] and the Rebel MC were arguably the first to bring the sound system influence solidly into releases. The track \"We Are I.E.\" by Lennie De Ice is often credited as being the track that laid down the foundations for jungle with its ragga bassline.[7] The infiltration of hardcore B-boys into the rave scene was catalyst for \"the messy birth-pangs of Britain's very own equivalent to US hip hop: jungle.\"[8] The UK B-boy's removal from American racial tensions made hip-hop's sample and beat-making more attractive than the \"protest side of rap,\" and spurred on their interest in the rave scene.[8] Alongside their 'sampladelic' taste, raving B-boys' use of MDMA fueled the more hyper sound that was passed down to jungle, even after the drug was left for marijuana. During 1992 and 1993, the phrases \"jungle techno\" and \"hardcore jungle\" proliferated to describe that shift of the music from breakbeat hardcore to jungle. The sound was championed at clubs such as AWOL,[9] Roast, and Telepathy, by DJs such as DJ Ron, DJ Hype, DJ Randall, Mickey Finn, DJ Rap, and Kenny Ken, record labels Moving Shadow, V Recordings, Suburban Base, and Renk,[10] and on pirate radio stations such as Kool FM (regarded as being the most instrumental station in the development of jungle) but also Don FM, Rush, and Rude FM. Tracks would span breakbeat styles, particularly with darkcore, with notable releases including \"Darkage\" by DJ Solo, \"Valley of the Shadows\" by Origin Unknown, \"Set Me Free\" by Potential Bad Boy, \"28 Gun Bad Boy\" by A Guy Called Gerald, \"Crackman\" by DJ Ron, \"A London Sumtin\" by Code 071, \"Learning from My Brother\" by Family of Intelligence, \"Lion of Judah\" by X Project, and \"Be Free\" by Noise Factory. Techniques and styles could be traced to such a vast group of influencers, each adding their own little elements. According to Simon Reynolds, jungle was \"Britain's very own equivalent to US hip-hop. That said, you could equally make the case that jungle is a raved-up, digitised offshoot of Jamaican reggae. Musically, jungle's spatialised production, bass quake pressure and battery of extreme sonic effects, make it a sort of postmodern dub music on steroids.\"[11] This is an example of the effects of the sonic diaspora and the wide influence musical genres have; Jungle is where these different Black Atlantic genres converge.[11] Reynolds noted the audience of the genre evolved alongside the music itself; going from a \"sweaty, shirtless white teenager, grinning and gurning\" to a \"head nodding, stylishly dressed black twenty something with hooded-eyes, holding a spliff in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other\".[11] Jungle also served as \"a site for a battle between contesting notions of blackness\".[12] Jungle reached the peak of its popularity between 1994 and 1995. At this stage, the genre was achieving a number of UK top 40 hits, including \"Incredible\" by M-Beat featuring General Levy, and spawned a series of CD compilations such as Jungle Mania and Jungle Hits. Controversy raged over the success of \"Incredible\" when Levy reportedly made comments in the media that he was \"running jungle at the moment\". Although Levy always argued that his comments were misinterpreted, this did not fail to stop a boycott of the single amongst a group of DJs that were dubbed as the \"Jungle Committee\".[13][14] Labels such as Ibiza, 3rd Party and Kemet were prolific in their releases.[15] Having previously been confined to pirate radio, legal stations woke up to jungle from 1994. London's Kiss 100 launched its Givin' It Up show in early 1994 and featured DJs on rotation including Kenny Ken Jumpin Jack Frost, DJ Randall, DJ Rap, and Mickey Finn. A year later, the UK's nationwide broadcaster BBC Radio 1 finally gave jungle a platform on its One in the Jungle weekly show.[16] Major labels such as Sony and BMG were signing deals with artists including A Guy Called Gerald, Kemet, and DJ Ron. Of these, Roni Size and 4hero would achieve wider commercial success as drum and bass artists, but continued to release more underground jungle tracks — the latter adopting the alias Tom & Jerry to continue to release rare groove sampling dancefloor-oriented jungle. The underground classic \"Burial\" by Leviticus would see a major release on FFRR Records. Jungle music, as a scene, was unable to decide whether it wanted to be recognised in the mainstream or if it wanted to avoid misrepresentation.[11] This manifested in the cooperation of jungle artists and small record labels. Small record labels worked to provide more autonomy to the music artists in return for their business and jungle music was proliferated by pirate stations in underground networks and clubs. Whilst the media would in part feed off jungle music success, it also perpetuated negative stereotypes about the scene as being violent. The seminal 1994 documentary A London Some 'Ting Dis, chronicled the growing jungle scene and interviewed producers, DJs,", "<2-hop>\n\nand ravers to counter this perception.[17][18] 1996 and 1997 saw a less reggae-influenced sound and a darker, grittier, and more sinister soundscape. Hip-hop and jazz-influenced tracks dominated the clubs in this period.[12] Dillinja, Roni Size, Die, Hype, Zinc, Alex Reece and Krust were instrumental in the transition of the jungle sound to drum and bass. By the end of 1998, the genre's sound had changed forms significantly from the sound heard earlier in the decade. Ragga jungle is a fusion genre that combines jungle with a heavy reggae influence. It would become a major subgenre during 1994 and 1995, with popular tracks such as \"Incredible\" by M-Beat featuring General Levy, \"Original Nuttah\" by UK Apachi and Shy FX, \"Sound Murderer / RIP\" by Remarc, \"Limb by Limb\" by Hitman featuring Cutty Ranks, and \"Code Red / Champion DJ\" by Conquering Lion.[19] In 1995, jump-up would also become a popular subgenre that came out of hardstep, with influences of various kinds of sound experiments, most importantly the bass line. Popular tracks of this subgenre include \"Dred Bass\" by Dead Dred, \"Super Sharp Shooter\" by DJ Zinc, \"This Style\" by Shy FX, \"R.I.P\" (DJ Hype Remix) by Remarc and DJ Zinc's remix of the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\". The genre would later regain popularity in the early 2000s with new productions by artists such as Shimon & Andy C, Bad Company, DJ Hazard and Pendulum.[20] The post-Thatcherite United Kingdom of the early 1990s had left many young people, particularly London's lower-class urban youth, disenfranchised and disillusioned with a seemingly crumbling societal structure. Jungle reflected these feelings, as it was a notably more dark, less euphoric style of music than many of the other styles popular at raves. The music was much more popular with black British youths than other rave styles, such as techno, even though it was heavily influenced by these other rave styles, including those from the United States.[11] Jungle music was also seen as \"England's answer to hip-hop\", aimed at breaking down racial boundaries and promoting unification through its multiculturalism by drawing from different cultures and attracting mixed crowds at raves.[12] Jungle's rhythm-as-melody style overturned the dominance of melody-over-rhythm in the hierarchy of Western music, adding to its radical nature.[11] Moreover, the greater accessibility to sampling technology allowed young people to create music in their homes by incorporating their own sampling and experiences, rather than needing a grand recording studio.[21] Characterised by the breakbeats and multi-tiered rhythms, Jungle drew support not only from British b-boys who got swept up into the rave scene, but also from reggae, dancehall, electro and rap fans alike. Simon Reynolds described it as causing fear and \"for many ravers, too funky to dance\"[11] yet the club scene enjoyed every second. The origin of the word jungle is one of discussion. Rebel MC is often noted for having popularised the term, and in Simon Reynolds' book Energy Flash, MC Navigator is quoted as attributing the word to him.[22] Others such as MC Five-O attribute it to MC Moose,[23] whilst Rob Playford (of Moving Shadow) attributes it to MC Mad P (of Top Buzz).[24] Some thought of this term as empowering, an assertion of the blackness of the music and its subculture, inverting the racist history of the term \"jungle music\".[12] Notable releases include: \"Burial\" by Leviticus, \"Dangerous\" by DJ Ron, \"Lover to Lover / Maximum Style\" by Tom & Jerry, \"Original Nuttah\" by Shy FX, \"All the Crew Big Up\" by Roni Size & DJ Die, \"Incredible / Sweet Love\" by M-Beat, \"The Helicopter Tune\" by Deep Blue, \"Super Sharp Shooter\" by DJ Zinc, \"Sovereign Melody / Lion Heart\" by Dillinja, \"Everyman\" by Kenny Ken, \"The Victory / Lovable\" by DJ Dextrous, \"Bad Ass\" by Aphrodite, \"The Lighter\" by DJ SS, and \"Tiger Style\" by DJ Hype.[25][26][27][28] The term \"jungle\" is often used as a synonym for drum and bass, particularly in the United States. More commonly, jungle is viewed as the originating point for drum and bass, with the progressive changes brought by artists in the late 1990s serving as the point of diversion (some examples being Trace & Ed Rush, LTJ Bukem, Photek, Total Science, Goldie and Optical). During this time, a false dichotomy was established between drum and bass and jungle, with the former for white ravers and the latter for black ravers.[29] The sub-genre of drum and bass developed to be quicker, more industrial, less danceable yet was seen as more 'accessible and commercial' than jungle, as cited in an article by The Observer in 1996.[30] In Black Music in Britain in the 21st Century, written by Julia Toppin in 2023, she explains, \"the process of modifying jungle's name can be viewed as an 'act of resignifying the otherness' to disassociate it from black people and the racist media narratives containing race, drugs, and violence with jungle music and the scene.\"[31] The jungle scene had always been portrayed in a negative light due to its affiliation with the rave scene and especially because of the black people associated with the music.[32] The security and drug incidents at jungle events typically seemed to attract more police attention than other EDM genres, though the same trouble would happen in any other raves attended by predominately white audiences. With the emergence of drum and bass, the previous biases against jungle intensified while drum and bass's popularity grew rapidly in mainstream media. In her article, Toppin highlights the sonic marginalization that occurred during the late 1990s, with black jungle ravers declined entry at night clubs and DJs being shadow-banned from playing jungle at venues.[33] This would lead to jungle's return to the underground at the end of the decade. A thriving underground movement producing and developing tracks in the style of the 1990s and some original (though mostly mainstream drum and bass) jungle producers have noticed this new enthusiasm for the original sound. Shy FX, for example, launched the Digital Soundboy label in 2005 to put out more jungle. The UK is still home to", "<3-hop>\n\na thriving jungle scene. Frequent jungle nights at the Corsica Studios has been pivotal to the continued success of the genre. The scene has grown with new producers such as Forest Drive West, Tim Reaper, Dead Man's Chest and Sully.[34][35] The early to mid-2000s saw a jungle revival in the emerging drum-funk subgenre, with labels such as Scientific Wax, Bassbin Records and Paradox Music pushing for a more breaks orientated sound. Technicality and Bassbin events in London were spearheading this return to more traditional elements of jungle music. One of the scene's originators, Congo Natty, continued to release jungle music throughout the 2000s, culminating in the 2013 album Jungle Revolution.[36] In 2018, Chase & Status produced an album exploring jungle sounds, RTRN II JUNGLE.[37]"], "reference": "Jungle is a genre of electronic music that developed out of the UK rave scene and Jamaican sound system culture in the 1990s.

It developed in the early 1980s in Western Europe, as an outgrowth of both the punk and the industrial music cultures.[10] It combines sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed disco rhythms, and mostly undistorted vocals and command-like shouts with confrontational or provocative themes.[9] The evolution of the genre reflected \"a general shift towards more song-oriented structures in industrial as to a general turn towards the dancefloor by many musicians and genres in the era of post-punk.\"[11][12] It was considered a part of the European new wave and post-punk movement and the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style of dancing (e.g. pogo).[13] EBM gained a stable following in the second half of the 1980s.[14] Around that period, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM[15] whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America) as rivetheads.[16] The term electronic body music was first used by Ralf Hütter of the German electronic band Kraftwerk in an interview with British music newspaper Sounds in November 1977.[17] In June 1978 Hütter reused the phrase in an interview with WKSU radio (Kent, Ohio) to explain the more physical character of the Kraftwerk album The Man-Machine.[18] Although the term originated in the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s when it reappeared and started to come into popular use.[19][20] EBM stands for 'electronic body music', a term which only really came into use when the Brits and Belgians stepped into the 'sequencer business' with bands like Nitzer Ebb and Front 242. There you could find that sound again, where it was catchily picked up and labelled. In our days all these terms didn't exist, not 'industrial' nor 'post-punk'. [...] To us it was sequencer music, that was what we did.[19] In 1981, DAF from Germany employed the term \"Körpermusik\" (body music) to describe their danceable electronic punk sound.[21][22] The term \"electronic body music\" was later used by Belgian band Front 242 in 1984[23] to describe the music of their EP of that year titled No Comment.[24][25] Described as an outgrowth of \"electronically generated punk [music] intertwined with industrial sounds,\"[26] EBM has been characterized as a composite of programmed drum beats, repetitive basslines, and clear or slightly distorted vocals, instructional shouts or growls[27] complemented with reverberation and echo effects.[9] Typical EBM rhythms rely on the 4/4 disco beat or rock-oriented backbeats,[8] (featuring kick drum, snare and hi-hat) and some minor syncopation.[28][9] Environmental samples, e.g. hammer blow, machine and alert sounds, are often used to create a \"factory ambiance\". Other samples include political speeches and excerpts from science fiction movies,[9] cf. Front 242 – Funkahdafi.[28] EBM evolved from a combination of post-punk, industrial and post-industrial music sources, including The Normal, Suicide, DAF, Die Krupps, Killing Joke, Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle[9] and Test Dept. but also krautrock and Berlin school[7] artists such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream (who had used electronic bass sequences as a basic feature in their productions).[4][9] The song \"Warm Leatherette\" (The Normal, 1978) stands at the beginning of an important development, the electrified version of Punk that had been picked up and transformed in Düsseldorf by bands like Die Krupps, DAF and Liaisons Dangereuses, music that might be called proto-EBM at least. [...] The role of sequencers, synthesizer and drum machine sounds for the creative process itself and its results are another interesting point concerning EBM. The use of these instruments contributed obviously to the formation of danceable grooves and sound textures that attracted a wider audience.[30] Other influences include the synth-pop music of The Human League and Fad Gadget; and the krautrock-inspired dance hit \"I Feel Love\" by Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer.[31][9] Daniel Bressanutti (Front 242), who helped establish the term EBM, named the soundscapes of Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze as additional influences along Kraftwerk, Throbbing Gristle, the sequencer-based electro-disco of Giorgio Moroder,[32] and the punk movement.[6] Emerging in the early 1980s in Germany and Belgium,[33] bands such as DAF, Die Krupps,[34] Liaisons Dangereuses,[30] and Front 242 started to blend danceable rhythms and repetitive sequencer lines.[35] At the time the genre arose, style-defining synthesizers included Korg MS-20,[35] Roland SH-101,[36] ARP Odyssey,[35] Emulator II,[28] along with several Oberheim and Yamaha models.[35] Archetypical songs are Verschwende deine Jugend, Alle gegen alle and Der Mussolini by DAF; Wahre Arbeit, wahrer Lohn, Goldfinger and Für einen Augenblick by Die Krupps; Etre assis ou danser, Los niños del parque and Avant-après mars by Liaisons Dangereuses, and Body to Body, U-Men and He Runs Too Fast for Us by Front 242. Front 242 characterized their approach as somewhere between Throbbing Gristle and Kraftwerk.[25] Nitzer Ebb and Portion Control, influenced by DAF[37] and Cabaret Voltaire, followed soon after. Groups from this era often applied socialist realist aesthetics, with ironic intent.[38] Other prominent artists were Pankow,[39] Vomito Negro, Borghesia, The Neon Judgement,[40] à;GRUMH...,[41][9] A Split-Second,[42] The Klinik, and Signal Aout 42.[43] In the second half of the 1980s, the genre became popular in Canada (Front Line Assembly[44]) and the U.S. (Ministry,[45] Revolting Cocks,[46] Schnitt Acht[47])[9] as well as in Sweden (Inside Treatment, Pouppée Fabrikk, Cat Rapes Dog) and Japan (2nd Communication, DRP, Soft Ballet). North American bands started to use EBM-typical bass sequences and combined them with the roughness of (hardcore) punk and thrash metal (cf. industrial metal). Nine Inch Nails continued the cross-pollination between EBM and rock music[48] resulting in the album Pretty Hate Machine (1989).[9] Meanwhile, EBM became successful in the underground club scene, particularly in Europe. In this period the most important labels were the Belgian Play It Again Sam and Antler-Subway, the German Zoth Ommog, the North American Wax Trax! and the Swedish Energy Rekords. Notable acts at that time included And One,[49] Armageddon Dildos,[50] Bigod 20,[51] Insekt,[52] Scapa Flow,[53] Orange Sector,[54] Paranoid,[55] and Electro Assassin.[56] Between the early and mid-1990s, many EBM artists ceased activities or changed their musical direction, incorporating more elements of rock, heavy metal and electronica. The", "<2-hop>\n\nalbum 06:21:03:11 Up Evil by Front 242 initiated the end of the EBM era of the 1980s. Nitzer Ebb, one of the most important purveyors of the genre, turned into an alternative rock band. Without the strength of its figureheads, electronic body music as a discernable music style faded by the mid-1990s.[9] In the late 1990s and after the millennium, Belgian, Swedish and German artists such as Ionic Vision, Tyske Ludder, and Spetsnaz[9] had reactivated the style. Based on this revival, Sweden and East Germany then became the centre of the movement[57] spawning a variety of newcomers. Primarily as a counteracting force against the expanding futurepop scene,[58] these artists followed a neo-traditionalistic path, often referred to as \"old school EBM\".[12] Simultaneously, a number of European techno producers started incorporating elements of EBM into their sound. This tendency grew in parallel with the emerging electroclash scene[9] and, as that scene started to decline, artists partly associated with it, such as The Hacker, DJ Hell,[59] Green Velvet, Black Strobe,[60] and David Carretta, moved towards this techno/EBM crossover style. There has been increasing convergence between this scene and the old school EBM scene. Some artists have remixed each other. Most notably, Terence Fixmer joined with Nitzer Ebb's Douglas McCarthy to form Fixmer/McCarthy.[61] EBM follows the transgressive approach of punk and industrial music (e.g. \"demystification of symbols\"[62]) and the use of provocative extreme imagery is common (e.g. Nazi paraphernalia;[63] reminiscent of punk's use of the swastika[64]).[65] Appropriating totalitarian, Socialist and Fascist references, symbols, and signifiers has been a recurring topic of debate between fans and outsiders to the genre alike due to its stylistical ambiguity that stems from industrial music's contrarian nature.[66] In one instance, military-themed band Laibach \"ma[de] no attempt to subvert this image [so] it has the aura of authenticity\" so \"[m]any Laibach fans began to revel in the evils of the band and to take their stage act at face value.\"[66] Bon and Doug were heavily influenced by DAF, Test Dept. and Einstürzende Neubauten. Hand in hand with the music was the image which unashamedly borrowed a lot from German and Soviet imagery. We all loved the sharp and striking design images of Russian and German '30s and '40s posters and artwork. Obviously we faced a lot of questions and objections about the ‚Neo-Nazi' image. But really we were just using the images to get people to sit up and listen. ‚Iconoclastic minimalism' was one phrase that was used to describe Nitzer Ebb at the time.[67] The military style of EBM has a \"part-human part-machine\" gestalt typical of transhumanist or cyberpunk movements. EBM asserts a hyper-masculine image of \"triumphalism, combat postures, and paranoia,\"[68] and is known for its \"tough-guy\" or machismo attitudes displayed by both men and women.[69] According to Gabi Delgado-López of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, the duo who adopted an aesthetic of black leather and military paraphernalia in the early 1980s was inspired by the male homosexual sado-masochistic scene and is not meant to represent \"machismo ideology\" but part of a \"role.\"[70] Electro-industrial is an outgrowth of the EBM and industrial music that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has minimal structures and a clean production, electro-industrial draws on deep, complex and layered sounds, incorporating elements of ambient industrial. Electro-industrial was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Numb and Mentallo & The Fixer. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the dark electro genre and, in the end of the decade, a strongly techno- and hard-trance-inspired style called \"hellektro\" or \"aggrotech.\" Industrial dance is a North American umbrella term for electronic body music and electro-industrial music. Fans associated with these genres call themselves rivetheads. In general, industrial dance is characterized by its \"electronic beats, symphonic keyboard lines, pile-driver rhythms, angst-ridden or sampled vocals, and cyberpunk imagery\".[71][72] Since the mid-1980s,[73] the term industrial dance has been used to describe the music of Cabaret Voltaire (early 1980s),[74][75] early Die Krupps,[76] Portion Control,[77] The Neon Judgement,[76] Clock DVA,[78] Nitzer Ebb,[79][80] KMFDM,[81][82][83] Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly,[84][85][86] Front 242,[72][76][80][87] Ministry,[88] Nine Inch Nails,[89][88][90] Manufacture,[91] Yeht Mae,[78] My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult,[92] Leæther Strip[93] or early Spahn Ranch.[94] In March 1989, Spin Magazine presented a two-paged special report about the industrial dance movement in Canada and the U.S.[91]"], "reference": "Electronic body music (EBM) emerged in the early 1980s in Western Europe, blending industrial music and synth-punk with dance music elements.

{"user_input": "How did the jungle music genre influence the later development of drum and bass in the UK?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nJungle is a genre of electronic music that developed out of the UK rave scene and Jamaican sound system culture in the 1990s. Emerging from breakbeat hardcore, the style is characterised by rapid breakbeats, heavily syncopated percussive loops, samples, and synthesised effects, combined with the deep basslines, melodies, and vocal samples found in dub, reggae and dancehall, as well as hip hop and funk.[1] Many producers frequently sampled the \"Amen break\" or other breakbeats from funk and jazz recordings.[2] Jungle was a direct precursor to the drum and bass genre which emerged in the mid-1990s.[3][4] The breakbeat hardcore scene of the early 1990s was beginning to fragment by 1992 and 1993, with different influences becoming less common together in tracks. The piano and uplifting vocal style that was prevalent in breakbeat hardcore started to lay down the foundations of 4-beat/happy hardcore, whilst tracks with dark-themed samples and industrial-style stabs had emerged from late 1992 and named darkcore. Reggae samples and reggae-influenced tracks had been a feature of many breakbeat hardcore tracks since 1990, particularly from producers such as Shut Up and Dance,[5] however Ibiza Records,[6] and the Rebel MC were arguably the first to bring the sound system influence solidly into releases. The track \"We Are I.E.\" by Lennie De Ice is often credited as being the track that laid down the foundations for jungle with its ragga bassline.[7] The infiltration of hardcore B-boys into the rave scene was catalyst for \"the messy birth-pangs of Britain's very own equivalent to US hip hop: jungle.\"[8] The UK B-boy's removal from American racial tensions made hip-hop's sample and beat-making more attractive than the \"protest side of rap,\" and spurred on their interest in the rave scene.[8] Alongside their 'sampladelic' taste, raving B-boys' use of MDMA fueled the more hyper sound that was passed down to jungle, even after the drug was left for marijuana. During 1992 and 1993, the phrases \"jungle techno\" and \"hardcore jungle\" proliferated to describe that shift of the music from breakbeat hardcore to jungle. The sound was championed at clubs such as AWOL,[9] Roast, and Telepathy, by DJs such as DJ Ron, DJ Hype, DJ Randall, Mickey Finn, DJ Rap, and Kenny Ken, record labels Moving Shadow, V Recordings, Suburban Base, and Renk,[10] and on pirate radio stations such as Kool FM (regarded as being the most instrumental station in the development of jungle) but also Don FM, Rush, and Rude FM. Tracks would span breakbeat styles, particularly with darkcore, with notable releases including \"Darkage\" by DJ Solo, \"Valley of the Shadows\" by Origin Unknown, \"Set Me Free\" by Potential Bad Boy, \"28 Gun Bad Boy\" by A Guy Called Gerald, \"Crackman\" by DJ Ron, \"A London Sumtin\" by Code 071, \"Learning from My Brother\" by Family of Intelligence, \"Lion of Judah\" by X Project, and \"Be Free\" by Noise Factory. Techniques and styles could be traced to such a vast group of influencers, each adding their own little elements. According to Simon Reynolds, jungle was \"Britain's very own equivalent to US hip-hop. That said, you could equally make the case that jungle is a raved-up, digitised offshoot of Jamaican reggae. Musically, jungle's spatialised production, bass quake pressure and battery of extreme sonic effects, make it a sort of postmodern dub music on steroids.\"[11] This is an example of the effects of the sonic diaspora and the wide influence musical genres have; Jungle is where these different Black Atlantic genres converge.[11] Reynolds noted the audience of the genre evolved alongside the music itself; going from a \"sweaty, shirtless white teenager, grinning and gurning\" to a \"head nodding, stylishly dressed black twenty something with hooded-eyes, holding a spliff in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other\".[11] Jungle also served as \"a site for a battle between contesting notions of blackness\".[12] Jungle reached the peak of its popularity between 1994 and 1995. At this stage, the genre was achieving a number of UK top 40 hits, including \"Incredible\" by M-Beat featuring General Levy, and spawned a series of CD compilations such as Jungle Mania and Jungle Hits. Controversy raged over the success of \"Incredible\" when Levy reportedly made comments in the media that he was \"running jungle at the moment\". Although Levy always argued that his comments were misinterpreted, this did not fail to stop a boycott of the single amongst a group of DJs that were dubbed as the \"Jungle Committee\".[13][14] Labels such as Ibiza, 3rd Party and Kemet were prolific in their releases.[15] Having previously been confined to pirate radio, legal stations woke up to jungle from 1994. London's Kiss 100 launched its Givin' It Up show in early 1994 and featured DJs on rotation including Kenny Ken Jumpin Jack Frost, DJ Randall, DJ Rap, and Mickey Finn. A year later, the UK's nationwide broadcaster BBC Radio 1 finally gave jungle a platform on its One in the Jungle weekly show.[16] Major labels such as Sony and BMG were signing deals with artists including A Guy Called Gerald, Kemet, and DJ Ron. Of these, Roni Size and 4hero would achieve wider commercial success as drum and bass artists, but continued to release more underground jungle tracks — the latter adopting the alias Tom & Jerry to continue to release rare groove sampling dancefloor-oriented jungle. The underground classic \"Burial\" by Leviticus would see a major release on FFRR Records. Jungle music, as a scene, was unable to decide whether it wanted to be recognised in the mainstream or if it wanted to avoid misrepresentation.[11] This manifested in the cooperation of jungle artists and small record labels. Small record labels worked to provide more autonomy to the music artists in return for their business and jungle music was proliferated by pirate stations in underground networks and clubs. Whilst the media would in part feed off jungle music success, it also perpetuated negative stereotypes about the scene as being violent. The seminal 1994 documentary A London Some 'Ting Dis, chronicled the growing jungle scene and interviewed producers, DJs,", "<2-hop>\n\nand ravers to counter this perception.[17][18] 1996 and 1997 saw a less reggae-influenced sound and a darker, grittier, and more sinister soundscape. Hip-hop and jazz-influenced tracks dominated the clubs in this period.[12] Dillinja, Roni Size, Die, Hype, Zinc, Alex Reece and Krust were instrumental in the transition of the jungle sound to drum and bass. By the end of 1998, the genre's sound had changed forms significantly from the sound heard earlier in the decade. Ragga jungle is a fusion genre that combines jungle with a heavy reggae influence. It would become a major subgenre during 1994 and 1995, with popular tracks such as \"Incredible\" by M-Beat featuring General Levy, \"Original Nuttah\" by UK Apachi and Shy FX, \"Sound Murderer / RIP\" by Remarc, \"Limb by Limb\" by Hitman featuring Cutty Ranks, and \"Code Red / Champion DJ\" by Conquering Lion.[19] In 1995, jump-up would also become a popular subgenre that came out of hardstep, with influences of various kinds of sound experiments, most importantly the bass line. Popular tracks of this subgenre include \"Dred Bass\" by Dead Dred, \"Super Sharp Shooter\" by DJ Zinc, \"This Style\" by Shy FX, \"R.I.P\" (DJ Hype Remix) by Remarc and DJ Zinc's remix of the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\". The genre would later regain popularity in the early 2000s with new productions by artists such as Shimon & Andy C, Bad Company, DJ Hazard and Pendulum.[20] The post-Thatcherite United Kingdom of the early 1990s had left many young people, particularly London's lower-class urban youth, disenfranchised and disillusioned with a seemingly crumbling societal structure. Jungle reflected these feelings, as it was a notably more dark, less euphoric style of music than many of the other styles popular at raves. The music was much more popular with black British youths than other rave styles, such as techno, even though it was heavily influenced by these other rave styles, including those from the United States.[11] Jungle music was also seen as \"England's answer to hip-hop\", aimed at breaking down racial boundaries and promoting unification through its multiculturalism by drawing from different cultures and attracting mixed crowds at raves.[12] Jungle's rhythm-as-melody style overturned the dominance of melody-over-rhythm in the hierarchy of Western music, adding to its radical nature.[11] Moreover, the greater accessibility to sampling technology allowed young people to create music in their homes by incorporating their own sampling and experiences, rather than needing a grand recording studio.[21] Characterised by the breakbeats and multi-tiered rhythms, Jungle drew support not only from British b-boys who got swept up into the rave scene, but also from reggae, dancehall, electro and rap fans alike. Simon Reynolds described it as causing fear and \"for many ravers, too funky to dance\"[11] yet the club scene enjoyed every second. The origin of the word jungle is one of discussion. Rebel MC is often noted for having popularised the term, and in Simon Reynolds' book Energy Flash, MC Navigator is quoted as attributing the word to him.[22] Others such as MC Five-O attribute it to MC Moose,[23] whilst Rob Playford (of Moving Shadow) attributes it to MC Mad P (of Top Buzz).[24] Some thought of this term as empowering, an assertion of the blackness of the music and its subculture, inverting the racist history of the term \"jungle music\".[12] Notable releases include: \"Burial\" by Leviticus, \"Dangerous\" by DJ Ron, \"Lover to Lover / Maximum Style\" by Tom & Jerry, \"Original Nuttah\" by Shy FX, \"All the Crew Big Up\" by Roni Size & DJ Die, \"Incredible / Sweet Love\" by M-Beat, \"The Helicopter Tune\" by Deep Blue, \"Super Sharp Shooter\" by DJ Zinc, \"Sovereign Melody / Lion Heart\" by Dillinja, \"Everyman\" by Kenny Ken, \"The Victory / Lovable\" by DJ Dextrous, \"Bad Ass\" by Aphrodite, \"The Lighter\" by DJ SS, and \"Tiger Style\" by DJ Hype.[25][26][27][28] The term \"jungle\" is often used as a synonym for drum and bass, particularly in the United States. More commonly, jungle is viewed as the originating point for drum and bass, with the progressive changes brought by artists in the late 1990s serving as the point of diversion (some examples being Trace & Ed Rush, LTJ Bukem, Photek, Total Science, Goldie and Optical). During this time, a false dichotomy was established between drum and bass and jungle, with the former for white ravers and the latter for black ravers.[29] The sub-genre of drum and bass developed to be quicker, more industrial, less danceable yet was seen as more 'accessible and commercial' than jungle, as cited in an article by The Observer in 1996.[30] In Black Music in Britain in the 21st Century, written by Julia Toppin in 2023, she explains, \"the process of modifying jungle's name can be viewed as an 'act of resignifying the otherness' to disassociate it from black people and the racist media narratives containing race, drugs, and violence with jungle music and the scene.\"[31] The jungle scene had always been portrayed in a negative light due to its affiliation with the rave scene and especially because of the black people associated with the music.[32] The security and drug incidents at jungle events typically seemed to attract more police attention than other EDM genres, though the same trouble would happen in any other raves attended by predominately white audiences. With the emergence of drum and bass, the previous biases against jungle intensified while drum and bass's popularity grew rapidly in mainstream media. In her article, Toppin highlights the sonic marginalization that occurred during the late 1990s, with black jungle ravers declined entry at night clubs and DJs being shadow-banned from playing jungle at venues.[33] This would lead to jungle's return to the underground at the end of the decade. A thriving underground movement producing and developing tracks in the style of the 1990s and some original (though mostly mainstream drum and bass) jungle producers have noticed this new enthusiasm for the original sound. Shy FX, for example, launched the Digital Soundboy label in 2005 to put out more jungle.
