"So, like, tell me, who was Little Richard, and what kinda music did he do, ya know?","The blues' 12-bar structure and the blues scale was a major influence on rock and roll music. Rock and roll has been called ""blues with a backbeat""; Carl Perkins called rockabilly ""blues with a country beat"". Rockabillies were also said to be 12-bar blues played with a bluegrass beat. ""Hound Dog"", with its unmodified 12-bar structure (in both harmony and lyrics) and a melody centered on flatted third of the tonic (and flatted seventh of the subdominant), is a blues song transformed into a rock and roll song. Jerry Lee Lewis's style of rock and roll was heavily influenced by the blues and its derivative boogie-woogie. His style of music was not exactly rockabilly but it has been often called real rock and roll (this is a label he shares with several African American rock and roll performers).[133][134]

Many early rock and roll songs are based on blues: ""That's All Right Mama"", ""Johnny B. Goode"", ""Blue Suede Shoes"", ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On"", ""Shake, Rattle, and Roll"", and ""Long Tall Sally"". The early African American rock musicians retained the sexual themes and innuendos of blues music: ""Got a gal named Sue, knows just what to do"" (""Tutti Frutti"", Little Richard) or ""See the girl with the red dress on, She can do the Birdland all night long"" (""What'd I Say"", Ray Charles). The 12-bar blues structure can be found even in novelty pop songs, such as Bob Dylan's ""Obviously Five Believers"" and Esther and Abi Ofarim's ""Cinderella Rockefella"". | Johnny Otis, who had signed with the Newark, New Jersey–based Savoy Records, produced many R&B hits in 1951, including ""Double Crossing Blues"", ""Mistrustin' Blues"" and ""Cupid's Boogie"", all of which hit number one that year. Otis scored ten top ten hits that year. Other hits include ""Gee Baby"", ""Mambo Boogie"" and ""All Nite Long"".[61] The Clovers, a quintet consisting of a vocal quartet with accompanying guitarist, sang a distinctive-sounding combination of blues and gospel.[62] They had the number five hit of the year with ""Don't You Know I Love You"" on Atlantic.[61][63][64] Also in July 1951, Cleveland, Ohio DJ Alan Freed started a late-night radio show called ""The Moondog Rock Roll House Party"" on WJW (850 AM).[65][66] Freed's show was sponsored by Fred Mintz, whose R&B record store had a primarily African-American clientele. Freed began referring to the rhythm and blues music he played as ""rock and roll"".

In 1951 Little Richard Penniman began recording for RCA Records in the jump blues style of late 1940s stars Roy Brown and Billy Wright. However, it was not until he recorded a demo in 1954 that caught the attention of Specialty Records that the world would start to hear his new uptempo funky rhythm and blues that would catapult him to fame in 1955 and help define the sound of rock 'n' roll. A rapid succession of rhythm and blues hits followed, beginning with ""Tutti Frutti""[67] and ""Long Tall Sally"", which would influence performers such as James Brown,[68] Elvis Presley,[69] and Otis Redding.[68] | Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with ""hillbilly"" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley.[39] Hispanic and Latino American movements in rock and roll, which would eventually lead to the success of Latin rock and Chicano rock within the US, began to rise in the Southwest; with rock and roll standard musician Ritchie Valens and even those within other heritage genres, such as Al Hurricane along with his brothers Tiny Morrie and Baby Gaby as they began combining rock and roll with country-western within traditional New Mexico music.[40] In addition, the 1950s saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar, and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, Link Wray, and Scotty Moore.[41] The use of distortion, pioneered by Western swing guitarists such as Junior Barnard[42] and Eldon Shamblin was popularized by Chuck Berry in the mid-1950s.[43] The use of power chords, pioneered by Francisco Tárrega and Heitor Villa-Lobos in the 19th century and later on by Willie Johnson and Pat Hare in the early 1950s, was popularized by Link Wray in the late 1950s.[44]

Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the payola scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an end.[45]","Little Richard Penniman was a highly influential rock and roll musician.  He initially recorded in a jump blues style before developing a faster, funkier rhythm and blues sound.  This new style, starting with hits like ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Long Tall Sally,"" helped define rock and roll and influenced many subsequent artists.","Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino were some of the first successful artists in the genre [Rock and Roll].",1.0,1.0,0.7324216958367855,N/A
"In the 1970s, who was the most successful musical group, and what genre did they belong to, ABBA?","One of the most successful European groups of the decade, and one of the best-selling acts with 380 million records sold,[21] was the quartet ABBA. The most successful Swedish group of all time, ABBA first found fame when they won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. They became one of the most widely known European groups ever, as well as Queen promo 1970s.  ""Waterloo"", ""Mamma Mia"", ""Take a Chance on Me"", ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"", ""Dancing Queen"", and ""The Winner Takes It All"" are just some of ABBA's most popular and most successful songs.

In the late 1970s, many bands in the United Kingdom began experimenting with synthesizers, forming the new wave style known as synthpop. Major synthpop bands around this time included Gary Numan and Tubeway Army, the Buggles, the Human League, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Other successful British new wave bands in the late 1970s included the Police, Echo & the Bunnymen, Adam and the Ants, Roxy Music, Squeeze, XTC, the Cure, the Stranglers, Joy Division, and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

The Bee Gees were one of, if not the 1970s biggest musical act dominating album sales, singles sales and music charts of many countries including the U.S. and UK. Most notably, they spearheaded and led the disco and pop music scenes of the 1970s at one point they had 5 songs in the top 10 and 3 songs in the top 5 of the U.S. Billboard charts according to Barry Gibb. They were the main artists and songwriters of the cultural and revolutionary music soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever which went on to become the second biggest-selling soundtrack of all time and up until Thriller it was the biggest-selling album of all time selling over 50 million copies worldwide. After achieving all of these huge records and milestones, some critics have labeled the Bee Gees as the decade-defining act of the 1970s. | 1970-1979
Only a handful of music genres were of the most successful and most popular during the 1970s. The first was soft rock (which was the “pop music” of that generation) and was led by artists such as Elton John, Chicago, The Eagles, Paul McCartney and Wings, The Doobie Brothers, Fleetwood Mac and Bruce Springsteen.
Another style that had much influence, especially in the latter half of the decade, was Disco, which was a dance style that was characterized by an electric sound and a strong beat. KC and the Sunshine Band, ABBA (the most successful group of the 70s), Village People, Donna Summer and The Bee Gees were the leading talents in this genre. The popularity of the genre was propelled by successful films featuring the music and lifestyle, such as Saturday Night Fever.
The last of the most successful styles of music was rock. In general, rock music became edgier during this time as a response to the lighter, peppier offerings of the disco genre. Led Zepplin was the most successful of this group (falling second overall to ABBA); others included The Who, Pink Floyd, AD/DC, Aerosmith, Joan Jett, Alice Cooper, and Blue Oyster Cult.
The decade saw the passing of many great musicians, some of which include: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, 3 members of Lynyrd Skynyrd (plane crash), Elvis Presley and Bing Crosby.
1980-1989
There are two artists that epitomize 80s music. The first is Michael Jackson. The songs “Beat It”, “Billie Jean”, and “Thriller”, were of his tops hits throughout the decade. The album Thriller has yet to be unseated as the best-selling album of all time. The other artist is Madonna. It was her second album, Like a Virgin, that catapulted her to the top of the charts. Her controversial lyrics and behavior quickly made her a household name, while her look influenced fashion throughout the decade. | The mid-to-late 1970s Australian band AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia, scoring a string of hits, albums and singles. They made their international debut in 1976 with High Voltage. The band quickly became successful outside their home country; the Highway to Hell album from 1979 peaked at number 13 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart and they would continue as one of the most popular rock groups in the world through the following decade.

The Bee Gees were a British group who had moved to Australia which consisted of brothers Barry, Maurice, and Robin Gibb — a successful harmonic act as the 1970s dawned. Aside from the chart-topping ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"" in 1971, the brothers did not make much impact in the US during the first half of the decade and most of their record sales were in Europe, especially on the continent. With the failure of their 1973 album Life in a Tin Can, the Bee Gees appeared washed up. But in 1975, they rebounded with Main Course which added more of a beat to their songs and they began embracing the new disco sound in their next album Children of the World (1976). The musical film Saturday Night Fever (1977) finally propelled the Bee Gees to global superstar status with ""Stayin' Alive"", ""More Than a Woman"", and ""Night Fever"" (from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack). The Gibbs' youngest brother, Andy, was a sensation with his own solo career. He made occasional appearances with his brothers and had hits with songs such as ""I Just Want to Be Your Everything"" and ""Shadow Dancing"".

The most successful female artist of the decade, English-Australian singer Olivia Newton-John, became a leading singer in the 1970s in both the pop and country genres and realized several number one hits, including the songs ""Let Me Be There"" and ""I Honestly Love You"" for which she received three Grammys.","ABBA was one of the most successful groups of the 1970s, selling 380 million records.

"So, like, what kinda music did Blink-182 make in the 90s?","The origins of 1990s pop-punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like Buzzcocks and the Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as the Jam and the Undertones, and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s.[234] Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars.[235] Punk music provided the inspiration for some California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including Rancid and Green Day.[234] In 1994, Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album Dookie, which found a new, largely teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including two number ones in the US.[212] They were soon followed by the eponymous debut from Weezer, which spawned three top ten singles in the US.[236] This success opened the door for the multi-platinum sales of metallic punk band the Offspring with Smash (1994).[212] This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day's Nimrod (1997) and the Offspring's Americana (1998).[237]

A second wave of pop-punk was spearheaded by Blink-182, with their breakthrough album Enema of the State (1999), followed by bands such as Good Charlotte, Simple Plan and Sum 41, who made use of humour in their videos and had a more radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, some of the attitude and even the look of 1970s punk.[234] Later pop-punk bands, including All Time Low, the All-American Rejects and Fall Out Boy, had a sound that has been described as closer to 1980s hardcore, while still achieving commercial success.[234] | Green Day and Dookie's enormous sales paved the way for a host of bankable North American pop-punk bands in the following decade.[232] With punk rock's renewed visibility came concerns among some in the punk community that the music was being co-opted by the mainstream.[229] They argued that by signing to major labels and appearing on MTV, punk bands like Green Day were buying into a system that punk was created to challenge.[233] Such controversies have been part of the punk culture since 1977 when the Clash were widely accused of ""selling out"" for signing with CBS Records.[234] The Vans Warped Tour and the mall chain store Hot Topic brought punk even further into the U.S. mainstream.[235]

The Offspring's 1998 album Americana, released by the major Columbia label, debuted at number two on the album chart. A bootleg MP3 of Americana's first single, ""Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)"", made it onto the Internet and was downloaded a record 22 million times—illegally.[236] The following year, Enema of the State, the first fully major-label release by pop-punk band Blink-182, reached the top ten and sold four million copies in under twelve months.[227] On February 19, 2000, the album's second single, ""All the Small Things"", peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. While they were viewed as Green Day ""acolytes"",[237] critics also found teen pop acts such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, and 'N Sync suitable points of comparison for Blink-182's sound and market niche.[238] The band's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and Untitled (2003) respectively rose to numbers one and three on the album chart. In November 2003, The New Yorker described how the ""giddily puerile"" act had ""become massively popular with the mainstream audience, a demographic formerly considered untouchable by punk-rock purists.""[239] | Skate punk broke into the mainstream in the mid-1990s, initially with the Northern California-based skate punk band Green Day and in the late 1990s with the Southern California-based pop punk band Blink-182 as well who all achieved massive worldwide commercial success. Green Day's album Dookie (1994) sold 10 million copies in the United States and another 10 million copies worldwide. Soon after the release of Dookie, The Offspring released the album Smash. The album sold over 14 million copies worldwide, setting a record for most albums sold on an independent label. In 1996, Weezer released its sophomore album Pinkerton, which became a major influence for many 2000s emo bands, although failing to reach the commercial success of the band's debut Weezer (Blue Album).[14] Rancid's Let's Go and NOFX's Punk in Drublic were also released during this period and both of them went gold as well. By the end of the year, Dookie and Smash had sold millions of copies.[15] The commercial success of these two albums attracted major label interest in skate/pop punk, with bands such as Bad Religion being offered lucrative contracts to leave their independent record labels. In 1999, Blink-182 made a breakthrough with the release of Enema of the State, which sold over 15 million copies worldwide receiving multi-platinum status in the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, New Zealand and platinum status in Europe and the United Kingdom. Green Day are seen as the biggest act in punk rock whilst Weezer and Blink-182 are seen to have the most influence on later bands like Fall Out Boy and All Time Low.","Blink-182's 90s music was pop-punk,  characterized by a faster tempo, humorous lyrics, and a more radio-friendly sound than earlier punk.

"I am very intrested in the music of Inda, can you tell me about it?","Indian Music encompasses numerous musical styles originating in many Asian countries.

Musical traditions in Asia | Popular music in Indonesia is often categorized as hybrid forms of Western rock to genres that originated in Indonesia and are indigenous in style.[15] The genre of music Dangdut is a genre of popular music specifically found in Indonesia. Dangdut formed from two other genres of popular music: indo pop and underground music[47] coming together to create a new fusion genre. Dangdut takes the noisy instrumentation from underground music, but makes it easier to listen to, like indo pop. Dangdut attempts to form many popular music genres like rock, pop, and traditional music to create a new sound that lines up with the consumers' tastes.[48] This genre has formed into a larger social movement that includes clothing, youth culture, the resurgence of Islam, and the capitalist entertainment industry.[15]

Another music scene that is popular in Indonesia is punk rock. This genre was shaped in Indonesia by the local interpretations of the media from the larger global punk movement.[47] Jeremy Wallach argues that while Green Day was seen as the ""death of punk,"" in Indonesia they were seen catalyst for a larger punk movement.[47] Punk in Indonesia calls on the English-speaking world to embrace the global sects of the punk subculture and become open-minded to the transnational genre.[47] | The Indian music industry was previously dominated by the filmi music of Bollywood for much of the late 20th century. The 2000s saw increasing popularity of independent Indian pop music that could compete with Bollywood film music. Indian pop music began distinguishing itself from mainstream Bollywood music with its fusion of Indian and non-Indian sounds, which later had on influence an Bollywood music itself. Indian pop has itself been partly influenced by the Asian Underground scene emerging in the United Kingdom among British Asian artists such as Bally Sagoo, Apache Indian, Panjabi MC, Raghav and the Rishi Rich Project (featuring Rishi Rich, Jay Sean and Juggy D). India has one of the largest music markets in the world, though like other developing nations, suffers from high levels of piracy.[356][357]

Indian music has also had an increasing influence on popular music in the Western world. The music of South Asia has influenced Europe's pop mainstream as acts like Björk, Bananarama, Erasure, and Siouxsie and the Banshees all released singles or remixes featuring South Asian instrumentation. Indian music has also influenced mainstream American hip hop, R&B and urban music in the 2000s, including artists/producers such as Timbaland, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Truth Hurts, The Black Eyed Peas, Missy Elliott and Britney Spears. According to DJ Green Lantern, ""Indian beats have now become a fixture on the R&B scene"".[358] Several Hollywood musical films such as Moulin Rouge! have incorporated Bollywood songs, while several Indian music composers have gained international fame, particularly A. R. Rahman who, having sold over 300 million records worldwide, is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[359][360] M.I.A., a British-born Sri Lankan electronic artist incorporates Bollywood songs in her music.[361]","Indian music encompasses diverse styles, with Bollywood filmi music dominating much of the late 20th century.

This article includes an overview of the major events and trends in popular music in the 1940s.

In the developed world, swing, big band, jazz, Latin and country music dominated and defined the decade's music. After World War II, the big band sounds of the earlier part of the decade had been gradually replaced by crooners and vocal pop.

Ragtime, a genre that first became popular in the 1890s, was popular through about the 1940s. After its best-known exponent, Scott Joplin, died in 1917, the genre faded. As the 1920s unfolded,  jazz rapidly took over as the dominant form of popular music in the United States.

In addition, a new form of popular music, crooning, emerged during the early 1930s. Technology played a large part in the development of this style, as electronic sound recording had emerged near the end of the 1920s and replaced the earlier acoustic recording. While singers such as Al Jolson and Billy Murray had recorded songs by yelling into a Victrola horn, as this was the only way to get audible sound with acoustic recording, the new electronic equipment allowed for a softer, more intimate style of singing. Many of the older singers such as Jolson and Murray consequently fell out of favor during the 1930s with changing tastes (although Al Jolson managed a successful career comeback after World War II).

Bing Crosby was the leading figure of the crooner sound as well as its most iconic, defining artist. By the 1940s, he was an entertainment superstar who mastered all of the major media formats of the day, movies, radio, and recorded music. Other popular singers of the day included Cab Calloway and Eddie Cantor. | In the early 1940s, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more complex ""musician's music."" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos.

The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's ""Cotton Tail"" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's ""Take the 'A' Train"" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called ""rhythm and blues"", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s.

By the end of the 1940s, the nervous energy and tension of bebop was replaced with a tendency towards calm and smoothness, that eventually influenced the birth of cool jazz, which favoured long, linear melodic lines in the 1950s.

By the 1940s, Dixieland jazz revival musicians like Jimmy McPartland, Eddie Condon and Bud Freeman had become well-known and established their own unique style. Most characteristically, players entered solos against riffing by other horns, and were followed by a closing with the drummer playing a four-bar tag that was then answered by the rest of the band.

Some of the most notable Jazz artists of the 1940s include Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong and also Nat King Cole. | 1940-1949
Popular music in the 1940s comprised of swing, jazz and big band music early in the decade. These styles suffered in popularity due to musicians’ strikes in 1942 and 1948 and eventually gave way to crooners later in the decade.
Swing music typically involves a lot of brass instruments that are led by a strong rhythm section. Its origins were decades earlier, but the genre was in its prime early in the 40s. Swing music started to decline in part because of the war: many musicians were directly involved in the war effort, and other bands suffered due to the cost of travelling with so many members and so much equipment.
Big band music is called such because of having a large ensemble of 12-25 musicians playing various instruments. Big band music is also considered a form of jazz. Glenn Miller and The Dorsey Brothers were leaders among big band musicians.
“Crooners” was a term used to describe male vocalists that often had powerful, professionally trained voices and maintained a specific posture or stage presence that could be described as intimate. Successful crooners include Nat “King” Cole, Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, and Dean Martin, among many others.
1950-1959
""Rock and Roll” was a term first used by Alan Freed, a disc jockey from Cleveland, Ohio, to describe the new form of music that was taking shape. It was influenced by rhythm and blues, gospel, and country music. The artists were often showmen, and the music usually included guitar solos. Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino were some of the first successful artists in the genre. Elvis Presley soon emerged on the scene and was as successful as he was controversial. Other popular groups include The Platters and The Coasters.","Swing, big band, jazz, Latin, and country music dominated the early 1940s.  Later in the decade, crooners and vocal pop gained popularity as big band music declined, partly due to wartime difficulties.

This was followed in 1866 by the 5 cent nickel (1866–1883), quarter dollar, half dollar, silver dollar and gold dollars. An 1865 law allowed the motto to be used on all coins. In 1873, the use of the motto was permitted, but not required. While several laws came into play, the act of May 18th, 1908 is most often cited as requiring the motto (even though the cent and nickel were excluded from that law, and the nickel did not have the motto added until 1938). Since 1938, all coins have borne the motto.

In early jazz, Louis Armstrong was well known for his virtuosity and his improvisations on the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings, and his switch from cornet to trumpet is often cited as heralding the trumpet's dominance over the cornet in jazz.[4][42] Dizzy Gillespie was a gifted improviser with an extremely high (but musical) range, building on the style of Roy Eldridge but adding new layers of harmonic complexity. Gillespie had an enormous impact on virtually every subsequent trumpeter, both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians. Miles Davis is widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century—his style was distinctive and widely imitated. Davis' phrasing and sense of space in his solos have been models for generations of jazz musicians.[43] Cat Anderson was a trumpet player who was known for the ability to play extremely high with an even more extreme volume, who played with Duke Ellington's Big Band. Maynard Ferguson came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton's orchestra, before forming his own band in 1957. He was noted for being able to play accurately in a remarkably high register.[44]

During the 1950s European popular music give way to the influence of American forms of music including jazz, swing and traditional pop, mediated through film and records. The significant change of the mid-1950s was the impact of American rock and roll, which provided a new model for performance and recording, based on a youth market. Initially this was dominated by American acts, or re-creations of American forms of music, but soon distinctly European Bands and individual artists began in early attempts to produce local Rock and roll music.","The motto ""In God We Trust"" first appeared on American currency in 1864.

How Streaming Services Influence Genre Popularity
Playlist Algorithms
Platforms like Spotify and Apple Music have revolutionized the way listeners discover music. These services use sophisticated algorithms to recommend music based on user behavior, pushing popular musical genres like hip-hop and pop to the forefront. Personalized playlists such as âTodayâs Top Hitsâ often feature these genres, helping them stay dominant.
Global Accessibility
Streaming platforms have made music from all corners of the globe easily accessible. International genres such as K-pop and Latin music have gained immense popularity, as platforms break down geographic barriers and expose listeners to diverse sounds from across the world.
Impact on Niche Genres
Niche genres like jazz, classical, and indie music have benefited from streaming services. While these genres may not dominate the charts, they are sustained by dedicated listeners who discover them through curated playlists, helping these genres maintain relevance and reach new audiences.
Genre Popularity by Region
North America
In the US and Canada, hip-hop, pop, and country music dominate the charts. Hip-hop has become a cultural powerhouse, while country continues to thrive, particularly in southern regions, and pop remains ever-present in mainstream media.
Europe
Pop and EDM are the leading genres across Europe, with festivals and clubs playing a key role in the dominance of electronic music. Rock maintains a strong presence, especially in countries like the UK and Germany, where both classic and alternative rock enjoy wide appeal.
Latin America | The 2020s saw the continued impact of streaming on the record industry, a trend that began in the 2010s. Platforms like Spotify played a central role in shaping music trends, driving the success of both mainstream and emerging genres. Social media, particularly TikTok, further amplified music with viral trends, while popular genres like hip hop, r&b, pop, country, edm, latin music, k-pop, and afrobeats dominated the Billboard Hot 100 charts.[16][17][18] At the same time, underground genres like hyperpop, plugg, jersey club, phonk, rage and indie music thrived in niche communities.[19][20][21][22][23]
British rock magazine Kerrang! wrote that Olivia Rodrigo's ""Good 4 U"" (2021) led the commercial comeback of rock music in 2020–2021, noting how it is the first rock song since Evanescence's ""Bring Me to Life"" (2003) to spend four or more weeks atop the UK Singles chart, alongside chart success of other rock-adjacent artists, such as Willow Smith, Machine Gun Kelly, Måneskin, and Miley Cyrus.[24] Slate proclaimed that Rodrigo ""might be the dying genre's best hope"", pinpointing that ""Good 4 U"" is the ""most up-the-middle rock song to top the [U.S.] Hot 100 in a decade or more"".[25]

Media outlets and fans online observed a music trend called ""Sad Girl Autumn"" or ""Sad Girl Fall"" in the early 2020s, which refers to the release of melancholic and introspective music by female artists during autumn, such as Swift's Red (Taylor's Version), Adele's 30, Clairo's Sling, Phoebe Bridgers' Punisher, and Mitski's Laurel Hell; it is a counterpart to ""Hot Girl Summer"", a catchphrase coined by American rapper Megan Thee Stallion with her 2019 song of the same name.[26] | Throughout the 2010s, hip hop music grew as a genre. In 2017, with the increase in streaming services influence over the Billboard Hot 100 rap music became the most popular genre in the US in its 4th decade of growth, surpassing Rock and Pop music.[5] Artists like Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Future, Chance the Rapper, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, J. Cole, Gucci Mane, Migos, Young Thug, Lil B, Tyler, The Creator, ASAP Rocky, 21 Savage, Cardi B, Big Sean, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, XXXTentacion and Juice WRLD all rose to prominence in this decade. In the decade, movements like Trap music, Cloud rap, Drill music, and Emo hip hop became mainstream.[6] The 2010s are also notable for the increasing prominence of rap producers; examples being Young Chop, Lex Luger, Sonny Digital, DJ Mustard, Metro Boomin, Southside,  DJ Khaled and Pi'erre Bourne .

Progressive and experimental rock have started to become widespread, mainly in the second half of the decade. Artists, such as Nothing More, Highly Suspect, Twelve Foot Ninja, Dead Letter Circus, and Marmozets, and DIY ethic bands, including Bad Omens, Sylar, Æges, and Silver Snakes, have enjoyed success through concerts and streaming services.","Streaming services heavily influence genre popularity.

"Considering the history of guitar and the rise of country music in the 1990s, how did the evolution of guitar design, as described in the context, contribute to the genre's growth and popularity during that decade?","Country music was aided by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Docket 80–90, which led to a significant expansion of FM radio in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural AM radio stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by talk radio (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the classic country format for the AM audience). At the same time, beautiful music stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, Billboard, which had published a country music chart since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on country radio determined a song's place on the chart.[111]

In the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to Garth Brooks,[112][113][114] who enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade. The RIAA has certified his recordings at a combined (128× platinum), denoting roughly 113 million U.S. shipments.[115] Other artists who experienced success during this time included Clint Black, John Michael Montgomery, Tracy Lawrence, Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson and the newly formed duo of Brooks & Dunn; George Strait, whose career began in the 1980s, also continued to have widespread success in this decade and beyond. Toby Keith began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the early 2000s with Pull My Chain and its follow-up, Unleashed. | There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar); the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played  across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a ""jazz guitar"". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.
Electric guitars, first patented in 1937,[2] use a pickup and amplifier that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood, without needing a resonant chamber.[3]  A wide array of electronic effects units became possible including reverb and distortion (or ""overdrive""). Solid-body guitars began to dominate the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s; they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback. As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music. | 1265
The first mention of a guitar in historical records.
1349
Records exist of the Duke of Normandy employing musicians playing instruments known as Guiterre Morische (Moorish Guitar) and Guitarra Latina (Latin Guitar). The Guiterre Morische evolved into the European Lute and the modern Arabic oud. The Guitarra Latina, however, eventually evolved into the guitar.

1400 – 1600 Renaissance Period
The gittern (English for Renaissance guitar) resembles a small lute or guitar. It was carved from a single piece of wood with a curved (“sickle-shaped”) peghead. An examplee has survived from around 1450.
The increasing reliance on the interval of the third as a consonance is one of the most pronounced features of early Renaissance European art music (in the Middle Ages, thirds had been considered dissonances: see interval). Polyphony, in use since the 12th century, became increasingly elaborate with highly independent voices throughout the 14th century. The beginning of the 15th century showed simplification, with the voices often striving for smoothness. This was possible because of a greatly increased vocal range in music — in the Middle Ages, the narrow range made necessary frequent crossing of parts, thus requiring a greater contrast between them. Stringed instruments gained strings to extend their usable range.
The modal (as opposed to tonal) characteristics of Renaissance music began to break down towards the end of the period with the increased use of root motions of fifths. This later developed into one of the defining characteristics of tonality.

"Considering the information about the evolution of music genres and the current trends, what is the relationship between the rise of Latin music and the emergence of Latin trap, and how has streaming influenced their popularity?","Immigration and globalization has caused Latin music to skyrocket in popularity.[90] Historically, the United States and Britain have had control over the music industry but the internet and technology has allowed for diversification and local music to become more prominent throughout the world.[90] The technological advancements have allowed streaming services to flourish that offer a wide variety of music without having to pay for each individual song/album.[94] The increase in Latin artists working with English speaking American artists has caused songs such as Ritmo by An American band, The Black Eyed Peas, and J Balvin, a Latin singer, to be number one on the billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. This increase has caused Latin music sales revenue in the US to rise from 176 million to 413 million dollars in 2018.[90] From 2016 to 2017, the amount of Latin songs on the billboard hot 100 increased from four to 19. Latin music surpassed Country and EDM in terms of album sales in the US in 2018.[90] This trend has caused pop music in the US to adopt certain styles from Latin music.[95] This has some experts questioning whether less popular Latin genres will become more niche in the future as record labels focus on products in industries with a greater concentration of money.[95] | Bolero music saw a resurgence of popularity with the younger audience. Mexican singer Luis Miguel was credited for the renewed interest with the success of his album, Romance (1991), a collection of classics covered by the artist.[79] Around the same time, artists from Italy such as Eros Ramazzotti, Laura Pausini, and Nek successfully crossed over to the Latin music field by recording Spanish-language versions of their songs.[80] In the tropical music field, merengue, which had gained attention in the 1980s, rivaled salsa in popularity.[81]

In the mid-2000s, reggaeton became popular in the mainstream market, with Héctor el Father Tego Calderón, Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, and Wisin & Yandel considered to be the frontiers of the genre.[82] In the tropical music scene, bachata music became popular in the field, with artists such as Monchy & Alexandra and Aventura finding success in the urban areas of Latin America.[83] Banda was the dominant genre in the Regional Mexican music field.[84]

By the turn of the decade, the Latin music field was dominated by up-tempo rhythms, including electropop, reggaeton, urbano, banda and contemporary bachata music, as Latin ballads and crooners fell out of favor among U.S. Latin radio programmers.[85] Streaming has become the dominant form of revenue in the Latin music industry in the United States, Latin America and Spain.[86] Latin trap gained mainstream attention in the mid-2010s with artists such as Ozuna, Bad Bunny, and Anuel AA.[87] | Numerous computer science and music experts have reported a common error on streaming services such as Spotify. Overlooking mainstay artists in catch-all genre terms such as Latin music, potentially causing a categorical homogenization of musical styles; incorrectly miscategorizing musicians and songs from heritage styles, such as Norteño, New Mexico music, Duranguense, and Tejano music, leading to underperformance of these styles on their platforms.[96][97][98][99] In addition, due to the fact that Spanish-language also includes music from Spain, artists from that country are labelled as ""Latin"". Following Rosalía's win for Best Latin Video for ""Con Altura"" at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Rosalía broached a related discussion, as to whether the expression ""Latin"" (derived from a Romance language, like Spanish) has been misunderstood and has evolved to the English interpretation of ""Latino"" (person from Latin American countries previously ruled by the Spanish and Portuguese empires), extending the debate about cultural appropriation and whether she should or should not be nominated in Latin categories at award shows.[100]","The rise of Latin music created a fertile ground for genres like Latin trap to emerge and gain mainstream attention.

Latin America | In the 2000s, with songs and pieces available as digital sound files, it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another. Some popular music forms have become global, while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin.[12] Through the mixture of musical genres, new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture.[13] The examples of Africa, Indonesia, and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles.[clarification needed]

Some sort of popular music has existed for as long as there has been an urban middle class to consume it. What distinguishes it above all is the aesthetic level it is aimed at. The cultural elite has always endowed music with an exalted if not self-important religious or aesthetic status, while for the rural folk, it has been practical and unselfconscious, an accompaniment to fieldwork or to the festivals that provide periodic escape from toil. But since Rome and Alexandria, professional entertainers have diverted and edified city dwellers with songs, marches, and dances, whose pretensions fell somewhere in between."" | Immigration and globalization has caused Latin music to skyrocket in popularity.[90] Historically, the United States and Britain have had control over the music industry but the internet and technology has allowed for diversification and local music to become more prominent throughout the world.[90] The technological advancements have allowed streaming services to flourish that offer a wide variety of music without having to pay for each individual song/album.[94] The increase in Latin artists working with English speaking American artists has caused songs such as Ritmo by An American band, The Black Eyed Peas, and J Balvin, a Latin singer, to be number one on the billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.

"In the context of the Renaissance Period, what were the characteristics of the gittern, and how did the guitar evolve during this time, considering the influence of the Italian humanist movement?","The Italian humanist movement, rediscovering and reinterpreting the aesthetics of ancient Greece and Rome, influenced the development of musical style during the period.
The first guitars are thought to have originated during the 15th Century in Spain. These had four ‘courses’ of strings or sets of two strings tuned to the same note to give the guitar resonance. However the Lute was consistently favored by the public over the Guitar until the end of the 15th Century.
1487
Johannes Tinctoris described two forms of the instrument — one “invented by the Spanish which both they and the Italians call the viola… This viola differs from the lute in that the lute is much larger and tortoise shaped, while the viola is flat and curved inwards on each side.” ‘Viola’ or ‘vihuela’ in Spanish, is not referring to the modern viola, but an early guitar. The other instrument described by Tinctoris is “the instrument invented by the Catalans, which some call the guiterra and others the ghiterne… the guiterra is used most rarely because of the thinness of its sound. When I heard it in Calaonia, it was being used much more often by women to accompany love songs, than by men.” In Italy these were known by other names: the ‘viola da mano’ with six courses of strings and the ‘chitarra’ with 4 courses of strings (or ‘guitarra’ in Spain).
1500s
Faxardo wrote that the guitarra “won’t bear the fingers but must be touched with a fine quill to make it exert its harmony.” Documents of the day refer to the Vihuela de Mano (played with the fingers) and the vihuela de penile (played with a quill).
Tobias Stimmer (1539-84) stated, “One can tell by the looks of it that it served as an introduction to the lute for accompanying old songs, for reciting old tales and a good many other things. We should preserve the tradition of our elders.”

The gittern was a relatively small gut-strung, round-backed instrument that first appeared in literature and pictorial representation during the 13th century in Western Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France, England). It is usually depicted played with a quill plectrum,[1] as can be seen clearly beginning in manuscript illuminations from the thirteenth century. It was also called the guiterna in Spain, guiterne or guiterre in France, the chitarra in Italy and Quintern in Germany.[2] A popular instrument with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs, the gittern is considered an ancestor of the modern guitar and other instruments like the mandore, bandurria and gallichon.[3][4]
From the early 16th century, a vihuela-shaped (flat-backed) guitarra began to appear in Spain, and later in France, existing alongside the gittern. Although the round-backed instrument appears to have lost ground to the new form which gradually developed into the guitar familiar today, the influence of the earlier style continued. Examples of lutes converted into guitars exist in several museums, while purpose-built instruments like the gallichon utilised the tuning and single string configuration of the modern guitar. A tradition of building round-backed guitars in Germany continued to the 20th century with names like Gittar-Laute and Wandervogellaute.
Up until 2002, there were only two known surviving medieval gitterns,[5][6] one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (see external links), the other in the Wartburg Castle Museum. A third was discovered in a medieval outhouse in Elbląg, Poland.[6][7]","The gittern, a small, gut-strung, round-backed instrument, was popular among court musicians and amateurs.

The Baroque guitar (c. 1600–1750) is a string instrument with five courses of gut strings and moveable gut frets. The first (highest pitched) course sometimes used only a single string.[1]


History[edit]
The Baroque guitar replaced the lute as the most common instrument found when one was at home.[2][3] The earliest attestation of a five-stringed guitar comes from the mid-sixteenth-century Spanish book Declaracion de Instrumentos Musicales by Juan Bermudo, published in 1555.[4] The first treatise published for the Baroque guitar was Guitarra Española de cinco ordenes (The Five-course Spanish Guitar), c. 1590, by Juan Carlos Amat.[5][6]
The baroque guitar in contemporary ensembles took on the role of a basso continuo instrument and players would be expected to improvise a chordal accompaniment. Several scholars have assumed that the guitar was used together with another basso continuo instrument playing the bass line.[7] However, there are good reasons to suppose that the guitar was used as an independent instrument for accompaniment in many situations.[8] Intimately tied to the development of the Baroque guitar is the alfabeto system of notation. | Girolamo Scotto

Acoustic guitars form several notable subcategories within the acoustic guitar group: classical and flamenco guitars; steel-string guitars, which include the flat-topped, or ""folk"", guitar; twelve-string guitars; and the arched-top guitar. The acoustic guitar group also includes unamplified guitars designed to play in different registers, such as the acoustic bass guitar, which has a similar tuning to that of the electric bass guitar.

Renaissance and Baroque
Main article: Baroque guitar
Renaissance and Baroque guitars are the ancestors of the modern classical and flamenco guitar. They are substantially smaller, more delicate in construction, and generate less volume. The strings are paired in courses as in a modern 12-string guitar, but they only have four or five courses of strings rather than six single strings normally used now. They were more often used as rhythm instruments in ensembles than as solo instruments, and can often be seen in that role in early music performances. (Gaspar Sanz's Instrucción de Música sobre la Guitarra Española of 1674 contains his whole output for the solo guitar.)[20] Renaissance and Baroque guitars are easily distinguished, because the Renaissance guitar is very plain and the Baroque guitar is very ornate, with ivory or wood inlays all over the neck and body, and a paper-cutout inverted ""wedding cake"" inside the hole.","I am sorry, but this document does not contain the answer to this question about Andrés Segovia's debut recital program and its relation to Francisco Tárrega's work.","In his debut recital in Granada, Spain in 1909, Andrés Segovia performed pieces by Francisco Tárrega, along with new transcriptions of piano works by Albéniz and Chopin, and some of his own compositions. This performance was significant because it marked the beginning of a career of more than 5,000 concerts and vastly increased the body of works available for the classical guitar, building upon the foundation laid by Francisco Tárrega, who died the same year.",0.0,1.0,0.8153291575946656,0.2038322893986664
