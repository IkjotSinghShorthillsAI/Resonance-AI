Early viols had round sound holes or rosettes, then C-holes in various placements. S-holes emerged in the 16th century and morphed into F-holes, which were used by both viols and violins. By the late 16th century, C-holes became outward-facing, a standard feature of the 'classic' 17th-century pattern. Some German and Austrian viols retained round/oval ports.",
        "expected_context": "It is commonly believed[15] that C-holes (a type and shape of pierced sound port visible on the top face or belly of string instruments) are a definitive feature of viols, a feature used to distinguish viols from instruments in the violin family, which typically had F-shaped holes. This generality, however, renders an incomplete picture. The earliest viols had either large, open, round, sound holes (or even round pierced rosettes like those found on lutes and vihuelas), or they had some kind of C-holes. Viols sometimes had as many as four small C-holes\u2014one placed in each corner of the bouts\u2014but more commonly, they had two. The two C-holes might be placed in the upper bouts, centrally, or in the lower bouts. In the formative years, C-holes were most often placed facing each other or turned inwards.\nIn addition to round or C-holes, however, and as early as the first quarter of the 16th century, some viols adopted S-shaped holes, again facing inward. By the mid-16th century, S-holes morphed into the classic F-shaped holes, which were then used by viols and members of the violin family alike. By the mid-to late 16th century, the viol's C-holes facing direction were reversed, becoming outward-facing. That configuration then became a standard feature of what we today call the \u201cclassic\u201d 17th-century pattern. Yet another style of sound holes found on some viols was a pair of flame-shaped Arabesques placed left and right. The lute- and vihuela-like round or oval ports or rosettes became a standard feature of German and Austrian viols and were retained to the very end. That feature was unique to viols and reminded one always of the viol's more ancient plucked vihuela roots, the \"cuteness\" of viols.",

Over the next 40 years or so the term found its way into audio recording in general, often in the context of making a copy of a recording on another tape or disc.\n\nIt was in this sense that the term was first used in the Jamaican recording industry: new recordings were often initially copied onto one-off acetate discs, known colloquially as soft wax[13] or dub and later as dubplates, for exclusive use by sound system operators; playing a song as an exclusive recording on a sound system was a good way for a producer to test the potential popularity of a recording before committing to the pressing of hundreds or thousands of copies of singles for retail sale. Initially, these acetates would simply be the standard recording of a song that was yet to be released on a single; around 1968\u201369, however, they started to be exclusive mixes with some or all of the vocal mixed out.",

It was capable of eight channels of sampled sounds at up to 16-bit resolution, had a wide selection of DSP effects, including a type of ADSR usually seen in high-end synthesizers of the time, and full stereo sound. This allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games, such as musical acoustics (early games like Super Castlevania IV, F-Zero, Final Fantasy IV, Gradius III, and later games like Chrono Trigger), directional (Star Fox) and spatial acoustics (Dolby Pro Logic was used in some games, like King Arthur's World and Jurassic Park), as well as environmental and architectural acoustics (A Link to the Past, Secret of Evermore).

Before the emergence of UKG, ragga MCs had a difficult time in the music scene but found solid footing through garage. Simon Reynolds wrote in Energy Flash: \"the rude-boy factor of the ragga patois voice in speed garage anthems like Gant's \"Sound Bwoy Burial\" probably acted to 'inoculate' against the 'effeminate' sensuality of house.\" Like the Jamaican dancehall toaster, the garage MC is a typically masculine and animated character which evokes responses from the crowd and engages their attention in a gritty, provocative manner.",

The hammer must strike the string but not remain in contact with it, because continued contact would damp the sound and stop the string from vibrating and making sound. This means that after striking the string, the hammer must quickly fall from (or rebound from) the strings. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently (thus preventing notes from being re-played by accidental rebound), and it must return to a position in which it is ready to play again almost immediately after its key is depressed, so the player can repeat the same note rapidly when desired.",

        "answer": "Originally, 'viola' (Italy) and 'vihuela' (Spain) were essentially synonymous and interchangeable generic terms for bowed instruments. 'Viola' was applied to both braccio precursors to the modern violin and to early Italian viols. As viols became less common, 'viola' was shortened from 'alto de viola da braccio' to refer specifically to the viola. The violin, or violino, was originally the soprano viola da braccio, eventually leading to the entire consort being known as the \"violin family\".",
        "expected_context": "The names viola (Italy) and vihuela (Spain) were essentially synonymous and interchangeable. According to viol historian Ian Woodfield, there is little evidence that the vihuela de arco was introduced to Italy before the 1490s. The term \"viola\" was never used exclusively for viols in the 15th or 16th centuries. In 16th century Italy, both \"violas\",\u2014the early viols and violins\u2014developed somewhat simultaneously. While violins, such as those of Amati, achieved their classic form before the first half of the century, the viol's form standardized later in the century at the hands of instrument makers in England.\nViola da gamba, viola cum arculo, and vihuela de arco are some (true) alternative names for viols. Both \"vihuela\" and \"viola\" were originally used in a fairly generic way, having included even early violins (viola da braccio) under their umbrella. It is common enough (and justifiable) today for modern players of the viola da gamba to call their instruments violas and likewise to call themselves violists. That the \"alto violin\" eventually became known simply as the \"viola\" is not without historical context, yet the ambiguity of the name tends to cause some confusion. The violin, or violino, was originally the soprano viola da braccio, or violino da braccio.

During the 1960s, digital computer music was pioneered, innovation in live electronics took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the music industry. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop, and electronic dance music (EDM). In the early 1980s, mass-produced digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture.",

        "expected_context": "Pio also notes that the fifth string of the viola da gamba is uniquely called a bordone (drone)\u2014both in the manuscript of the early 15th-century music theorist Antonius de Leno, and in the treatises of the Venetian Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego and Giovanni Maria Lanfranco\u00a0[de]. However, it is not a drone and is played the same as the other strings. This inconsistency is justified, Pio argues, only by assuming the invention (in the latter 15th century) of a larger instrument derived from the medieval violetta, which gradually added more strings to allow greater extension to the low register. The fifth string was incorporated into the neck. This was surpassed by a sixth string (basso) which fixed the lower sound produced by the instrument. Pio's view was: the origin of the viola da gamba is tied to the evolution of the smaller violetta, or vielle, which was originally fitted with a fifth-string \"drone\"; and the name 'stuck' even after it ceased to perform this function.",

Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor),[13] while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings are normally flatwound with a metal (or synthetic) core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which makes it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos.

One theory is that it derives from the French phrase Les haricots [ne] sont pas sal\u00e9s,[7] which, when spoken in Louisiana French, is pronounced [lez\u203fa.\u027ei.ko s\u0254\u0303 pa sa\u02c8le]. This literally translates as \"the green beans aren't salted\" and is used idiomatically to express hardship.\n\nAnother possible root word for zydeco is a West African term for \"musicking\". Recent studies based on early Louisiana recordings made by Alan and John Lomax suggest that the term, as well as the tradition, may have African origins. The west African languages of tribes affected by the slave trade provide some clues as to the origins of zydeco. In at least a dozen languages from this culture-area of Africa, the syllables \"za\", \"re\", and \"go\" are frequently associated with dancing and/or playing music\".",

Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor),[13] while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings are normally flatwound with a metal (or synthetic) core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which makes it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos.",
